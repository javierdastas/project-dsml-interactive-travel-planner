        "description": "Plan a day trip to the only tropical rainforest in the U.S. National Forest System. With 29,000 acres of lush foliage and 25 miles of year-round trails, this is a nature enthusiast’s sanctuary. Attempt to spot elusive wildlife like the Puerto Rican parrot on a rejuvenating hike, soar through the canopies on a zipline, or go horseback riding at Carabalí Rainforest Park. If time permits, visit the Yokahú Observation Tower which has an elevation of 1,575 feet and provides expansive views of the mountains. Sporadic showers are common here—check their website for the latest information about trail statuses and park closures before setting out.",

Their visitor's center is quite excellent and is worth the initial stop as an introduction to so many of the unique parts of the rain forest.  We didn't get a lot of hiking time for our trip, but we did get to see some of the highlights off of the main road.  It's definitely worth visiting if on the island.",

I booked an event for my 84 Aunt birthday and invited 50 guest and the owner went over and Beyond his service they treated us as if we was part of his family. The service was excellent the food and the atmosphere and all his staff. I highly recommend this restaurant for any special event or just to stop bye for lunch. Thank you Edwin for being part of this beautiful memory that my Aunt and family will always treasure in our life's.",

The path was well worn, but there was some scrambling and climing involved near the top.  I had hiking shoes, think hiking boots and gloves would be a good idea. There weren't too many markings but the path was well used, it would be hard to miss the trail.  There was absolutely no litter along the trail and greenery and occasional birds were pleasant to see, bring a camera.",

The rooms are not clean, the bathroom are nasty , there’s no proper cleaning nor lighting in the rooms. The closet doors are broken and also the windows. The curtains for privacy is peeling off, the setting of the room make it difficult to walk. You cant walk at night, there’s no lights. I have to use my cell phone flashlight to see, that is dangerous and scary. Also not safe. They have a deck in the back where the hammocks are and the wood is rotting away, you don’t even dare to step on it. Not enough staff. Frankly is horrible!",

We stopped in twice for daily Mass during our recent trip to San Juan.  Nice service, nice priest celebrated the Mass, love to see the Franciscan friar habits… very cool.  Very interesting confessional, just an office chair on wheels, which is chained to the wall!  :-)  For those interested, Mass is celebrated in Spanish, and, as of the date of this review, daily Mass (M-F) is at 12:15pm, and Sunday Masses are at 7:00am, 9:00am and 11:00am.  It was a beautiful service… recommend to stop by for Mass or just to see the church!",

Hop on a banana boat for a thrilling ride around the beach, then hit the food trucks around the pier for a pina colada and casual Puerto Rican fare. Later in the day, walk to the lookout to watch the sunset. You'll find picnic tables but no showers or toilet facilities. Both paid and free parking is limited, so be sure to arrive early. Or consider visiting along a tour of west Puerto Rico. – Tripadvisor",

We met Pedro who has a little area set up for his use with decorations that he has found in the ocean and his row boat. He was so kind to show us the fish that he caught and to help us harvest 4 fresh coconuts with the sweetest coconut water. They went from tree to tummy in less than 10 minutes. A+++ experience. The water is very calm here making it ideal for young children.",

        "review_summary": "The Cathedral of Saint Philip the Apostle was built beginning in the late 18th century. The first church, built in the middle of the 17th century, was destroyed by an earthquake in 1787. Construction of its replacement began soon after, although it was not completed until 1846. Four days after its dedication, an earthquake seriously damaged it. Repairs were not completed until 1882. The 1918 earthquake damaged the vault so badly that it was replaced by a flat concrete roof; a vaulted ceiling of composition board was placed inside.\nThe cathedral of Arecibo is Puerto Rico's second-largest church after the Cathedral of San Juan. The plan is rectangular with three naves; the side naves are cut short to allow large flanking chapels, which occupy almost half the length of the church. The apse is semicircular, and has an unusual half-dome covering it. The facade is a triangular composition of three stages. The top stage, a short central tower, is a later addition, according to local architects and historians. Neoclassic ornamentation is used in an academic fashion on the lowest stage, but the other two show a less traditional use of bands and pilasters. The Renaissance-style windows are uncommon in Puerto Rican churches, but the central tower over the entrance is a common motif used throughout the island.\n",

        "review_summary": "A nice stop along the northern shore.  I read the conflicting reviews about parking.  All beaches in PR are free, and you can find a place to park.  If you do decide to park for free, do it on the east side of the arch (before you get to the paid lot).  That said, we paid to park and it gives you a good spot to start (and there are porta potties).   \n\nWe went to the cave and then the arch.  My family is adventurous and I would not recommend going into the cave.  Once you get to the bottom, which is about 20 feet down, it's a small space and there isn't much to see or explore. 5 minutes down there and you are ready to go out.  However, there is the problem.  The entry hole is small and \"one-way\", so if a tour group is behind you then you could be stuck down there for a while. This happened to us.   The tour guides were very rude.  They would not the 2 of us get out before they got their people through the opening.  That said, there is a trick to getting out if you have the ability to climb.  If you at the bottom and are facing the carvings on the wall, turn to your right and there is a pocket that you can enter and climb up and out. My son is 12 and was the one to figure it out.  It's was fairly easy to do but do so at your own risk.  We saw another couple later in the day and they said they were stuck down there for about 40 minutes, as they were not comfortable with the climb.  Also as you walk around up top, there are about 5 holes that are the size of a manhole cover.  If you fall through it's not going to end well.  Do not walk and take pictures at the same time.  Pay attention.\n\nWe then worked east toward the beach/arch.  It is a easy, short hike that leads to some very nice views.\n\nOverall a nice spot - but think twice about the cave if it is crowded.",

The waves crash into the rocks creating a natural water show!.\n\nSurfing\nTo the right of the rocks is a nice area for surfing! the breaks are even and the reef is not that far from shore.  Sandy bottom \n\nFood \nThere a lot of cool spots to check out\n A long the way “Frituria” these are fried food favorites!  You can’t  go wrong. \n\nSafety\nIt was safe. I saw the police ride through. No one was walking the beach trying to sell you anything. The vendors if any have a tent setup outside the beach.  That sell tourist stuff. \n\nIf you Respect the ocean and understand its force you will have a safe time. At least once a year someone losses their life here because they forget that and go beyond the safety of the rocks per Dio Louie.",

First, I posted a message on the main page of El Parque de Las Ciencias. A representative replied to my message that they would sent me a direct message. On FB Messenger a representative confirmed that the event was canceled; however none of their social platforms were advising the public of a potentially/confirmatory cancellation of the event. At that point, I requested a again a refund because I was limited to reschedule. Their policy is to offer no refunds, so they offered me to reschedule for the following day, 2 January 2025. I rescheduled my time to attend the event at 6pm. However, at the time of arrival on 2 January 2025, the representatives on site were telling us that they were just told that there had been an explosion in the area and that they were told at that time to cancel. I informed the representative that there had not been a communication to us about the cancelation of the event until the arrival. Therefore, again I requested a refund because this time a wasn't able to attend since I do not live in PR and was there for the holidays. Moving forward, the Customer Services Supervisor (Mayra Ortiz) told me that in this instant I would receive a refund. \n\nNOTE: The two cancelations were not because of me but because of the power outage and/or issues, which is not a weather issue, age/height/weight restrictions, not wearing appropriate shoes, or by being scared of the activity (see Toro Verde's policy). \n\nOn the same night of 2 January 2025 at 9:02pm AST, I received a text that they understood the issue and had transferred my issue to the appropriate department with an expected date of refund between 7-14 days. \n\nOn 16 January 2025, I contacted Toro Verde via text message since this had been the only option (outside of FB Messenger) to communicate with them. Their reply was that it would take 2-3 weeks for my refund. You note that it was a different answer specifically to time (e.g., adding more weeks).\n\nToday, 24 January 2025, I decided to call Toro Verde at (787) 867-7100 to get an update. I requested a supervisor or the one in charge (i.e., los encargados as their staff refers to them). Tony Mendez from Toro Verde's Call Center could not find a supervisor within 10 minutes of putting me on hold. He then proceeded to check on my claim and let me know that \"I was informed that I would not receive a refund.\" I replied to him to provide me a date/format (i.e., phone call, text, FB Messenger) of such communication to me since as of last week, everything was going to be refunded. He said, \" I'm sorry but I am being honest, and that is what I am seeing on the screen.\" Nevertheless, I still requested a supervisor/\"encargado\" to discuss the issue but again no one was available. Tony, offered me to have my issue be transfered to a \"supervisor/encargado\" and for them to contact me. He replied that there wasn't anyone available. \nI kept on explaining to him thst my issue/claim was transferred on 2 January 2025 and no one has contacted me, outside of the times that I have contacted them. By the 23rd minute of the phone call he hung up the phone.\n\nLike some other reviews for Toro Verde (i.e., zipline, The Beast, etc.), it seems that they do not care about the experience that you have but mainly about pushing the consumer to reschedule when at some point it is not plausible and reasonable (e.g., I do not live in PR, and the event was pushed to 2 February). Yes, they do have multiple good reviews of visitors who have successfully attended their activities. However, I cannot fathom the delay on such refund (e.g., since 2 January 2025) and the misinformation of now not receiving the refund. \n\nFurthermore, at no point there has been a verbal communication with me from any supervisor/encargado from Toro Verde to provide me of any updates to my refund. Every communication has started from my side and only today I was able to talk with a representative. \n\nFinally, would it not be easier to refund $83.07 for a unsatisfied customer who did not receive the service, outside of the merchant's policy, when there is a high demand for your services?\n\nThanks.",

My aunt and her husband with some of their coworkers came with us. I remember when I looked over boat before arriving the water was crystal clear. You could literally see the ocean floor. It wasn’t what it is now, Of course. It’s been renovated.But still we had so much fun. This was on a summer vacation to Puerto Rico back then. I remember telling my friends at school that I’d walked the whole island and they were at awe. I remember finding different types fish while walking around the small island.  Beautiful place to go with family. I hope visitors keep the island clean and respect it’s beauty so that others can enjoy it as much as we did.",

        "review_summary": "Our family has tried to visit the park on December 22, 2024. The park was closed and the guard at the closed gate told us that it has been closed for 4 months until further notice. It is not allowed to enter neither the park nor the caves. There were dozens of cars which stopped at the gate while we were there only to leave in disappointment. We were standing near the gate for more than an hour researching if there was any other way to see the caves (with some tour or by entering through a different entrance to the caves). Unfortunately, no web-site states that the park is closed and the tour pages just say that their activity is not available at this time. So, it is not communicated to the public that one cannot visit the caves at this time. This is sad since quite a lot of people are likely visiting Puerto Rico to see the caves and consider them as one of the island's main attractions, as it was in our case.",

Our server Jeriel was so attentive and kind, he made sure everything was to our liking and gave excellent service. I actually almost forgot to write this review, it's been a few weeks since I went but the service and food were so good I had to make sure I left a review. Highly recommend.",

The  main courses were good but not great. The fried red snapper was a little over done but the skin was salty and nicely crisp. The grouper was nicely cooked and very tasty. The sides were wanting. Too much rice and slightly watery beans.\nWe would go again for drinks and appetizers and choose different sides with the main courses. It’s worth going for the fine service.",

We didn't have seatbelts (island life, I guess!) so that might be something to consider. I would assume the smaller car taxis do. We would 100% use their service again!",

Or anybody who likes to explore abandoned places.\n\nThis was a fairly large U.S Naval Air station until it closed in 2004. The airfield is still open as a civil field. The rest of the expansive base has been transformed into a nature/public recreational reserve.  \n\nAfter 17 years of abandonment, nature has definitely taken its course. \n\nMost the base remains, but left to the elements for 17 years.  And at least one major hurricane. Shoppings plazas, theater, hotel, base housing, gas station, fuel depot, military buildings, hangars, etc. A small town. All abandoned and exposed to the elements as nature takes over. \n\nWe spent three hours just driving around exploring.  Mostly unrestricted. The roads are still there. Just with nature taking over on some of the back roads. People out biking and enjoying themselves. Not many people, though, albeit the occasional biker or security patrol.  It was like we were the only ones out there.\n\n",

In the end, it was so quiet while we were there so maybe that was because parts were closed? We enjoyed the Las Delicias falls and the Dona Juana falls - both were breathtaking. I would have liked to have found a website online with the hours and hikes in the forest, but no such luck. Maybe it is out there and I just missed it. Anyway, we enjoyed our visit.",

There are food stalls that sell food and drinks, shower facilities, and umbrellas that you can rent. As you walk along the shores, spot Flamenco’s most iconic attraction: the abandoned World War tanks decked in graffiti—a reminder of the US Navy’s occupancy of Culebra. It's a popular day trip spot from San Juan, so expect it to be busier on the weekends. Have your day sorted with a tour of Culebra Island, which typically includes transfers to the island and activities like snorkeling. – Tripadvisor",

He and his wife were super kind and knowledgeable, and they ensured we had the time of our lives. The island is absolutely stunning and practically private. Gammy provided everything: beach chairs, umbrellas, two paddleboards, a cooler, snorkel gear, tips about where to go, a map... he even brought water for the bozos who didn't bring enough (hi, it's me.)\n\nThey picked us up and dropped us off at pre-arranged locations, which was incredibly helpful. The boat ride is smooth and the island is incredible. If you're in Culebra, DO NOT MISS a trip to Culebrita with Gammy. It beat Flamenco and Tamarindo for me (both of which are also absolutely lovely).\n\nThank you, Gammy! You rock!",

When you arrive at the parking lot walk to the west and you’ll see a new boardwalk.  Take this to the far end ( about 200 meters) and you’ll come out to the broad sandy beach.  Water was clean here other than being roiled up by waves.  It plunged deep fairly close to shore probably due to the waves.  Often at the beaches near here we would encounter patches of seaweed but here it wasn’t bad and you could get into the water and easily avoid it.  \n\nThe only negative to this beach was when we were here there were strong easterly winds with big waves and a strong undertow.",

Zoni is just as beautiful as the famous Flamenco Beach due to its indistinguishable white sands and clear waters. However, unlike Flamenco but much like all other Culebra beaches, Zoni does not offer any amenities, such as bathrooms, parking, kiosks, etc. It's a lot less populated than Flamenco, therefore, considered a more peaceful environment. Zoni's waters are deep and you should expect some waves, especially during winter. But don't let that throw you off, Zoni Beach offers different beach activities for every visitor; there's a large open area for sunbathing, playing beach volleyball, soccer o tennis, among others. If you're visiting between April and June, don't forget to be on the lookout for turtle nesting sites! Although, of course, do not walk over them or play around them. Overall, Zoni Beach is an obvious alternative for people who want to get away from it all and enjoy a relaxing day at the beach.Information sourced from enculebra.com",

We were the 1st to go out at 8:50 am. The water was calmer early that day, and the sun was not too hot yet. It took about us about 20 mins to reach the small island, and we beached on the north side. Pelicans and birds greeted us, and we saw a sign indicating it is a manatee zone. The snorkeling was good, but only go if you are a strong swimmer and an experienced kayaker. After a while, we explored the channels dividing the 2 cays. The waters were clear and warm. We saw a giant gar and birds of all types. The mangroves  protect this wildlife sanctuary. It was an unforgettable morning, and we hope to return one day soon. There are no facilities here, so be sure to pack all the needed essentials. The tides and wind worked in our favor upon our return. As we left, a couple of small boats arrived with visitors. We're adventurous and recommended the trip to anyone who can get out there.",

The movie theaters are awesome!!! Recently renovated and all have nice leather reclining chairs with tray tables where you can eat.  There is also a nice variety of food to order.

The beach is great with a few little covered picnic tables and a large protected pool for swimming. There were some waves but it was safe for kids and we saw a few people snorkeling. Not a lot of shade though so plan accordingly for that. No permanent bathrooms but when we were there they had portapotty. Kind of a lot of trash in the parking area but the beach was clean.",

The beach is great with a few little covered picnic tables and a large protected pool for swimming. There were some waves but it was safe for kids and we saw a few people snorkeling. Not a lot of shade though so plan accordingly for that. No permanent bathrooms but when we were there they had portapotty. Kind of a lot of trash in the parking area but the beach was clean.",

Major attractions here include the colonial sights of San Antonio de Areco itself, the Museum of the Gaucho (which celebrates Argentine cowboys), and a variety of estancias themselves, which are located within two hours of San Antonio de Areco. If you don’t feel like planning your own itinerary, several tour and travel companies will coordinate your visit and arrange your estancia stay.",

I did go in and stayed close to shore, it ended up ok but i didn’t see that much. Ultimately other places better for snorkeling in the north/west. Also parking is limited to like 5 spots total, easy to drive right past the grassy nook but there is a sign once you look closely. No street parking. A friendly dog escorted us from parking to the beach, how nice! Only stayed a short time to check out other spots.",

First walking out onto the sand, no spots too crowded, but if you walk away down the beach there is less people. The volleyball court was active, surfers everywhere, pickleball in the sand - lots happening here. Reviews from others got me nervous about going in the water here. Everyone talks about the strong currents and how many have drowned or needing saving. I did go in and I can attest the current is strong. I stayed very cautious close to shore with my snorkel. Surfers including young kids on their boards well out into the big waves. It’s so tempting to go out that way but not a casual swim. I did see some fish clearly in the areas I swam which was nice.",

On day of tour, entire family leaves sunny San Juan for a 2 hour drive to Hacienda Lealtad. It is raining lightly when we arrived about an hour before tour scheduled and forecast showed it was   clearing up. At the gate, guard informs us that all tours were canceled due to the rain.  I had not received a call or text to notify me of this.  After being turned away at the gate, I called the office and they  confirmed that all tours were canceled due to heavy thunderstorms.   She was unable to refund my card and had to take my information to give to the refund department?  Not sure when or if I will get refunded,  but a precious vacation day was wasted driving 4 hours for nothing when a simple text or call from the establishment could have prevented it. ",

The scenic hike to the cave also boasts pretty coastal views and impressive grassy cliffs.

        "review_summary": "A nice stop along the northern shore.  I read the conflicting reviews about parking.  All beaches in PR are free, and you can find a place to park.  If you do decide to park for free, do it on the east side of the arch (before you get to the paid lot).  That said, we paid to park and it gives you a good spot to start (and there are porta potties).   \n\nWe went to the cave and then the arch.  My family is adventurous and I would not recommend going into the cave.  Once you get to the bottom, which is about 20 feet down, it's a small space and there isn't much to see or explore. 5 minutes down there and you are ready to go out.  However, there is the problem.  The entry hole is small and \"one-way\", so if a tour group is behind you then you could be stuck down there for a while. This happened to us.   The tour guides were very rude.  They would not the 2 of us get out before they got their people through the opening.  That said, there is a trick to getting out if you have the ability to climb.  If you at the bottom and are facing the carvings on the wall, turn to your right and there is a pocket that you can enter and climb up and out. My son is 12 and was the one to figure it out.  It's was fairly easy to do but do so at your own risk.  We saw another couple later in the day and they said they were stuck down there for about 40 minutes, as they were not comfortable with the climb.  Also as you walk around up top, there are about 5 holes that are the size of a manhole cover.  If you fall through it's not going to end well.  Do not walk and take pictures at the same time.  Pay attention.\n\nWe then worked east toward the beach/arch.  It is a easy, short hike that leads to some very nice views.\n\nOverall a nice spot - but think twice about the cave if it is crowded.",

Yesterday a 26 year old tourist was lost in a rip current and we watched the coast guard and local rescue teams search for hours to no avail.  Just last week another adult male tourist drowned shortly after a surfing lesson.  You really need to know what you’re doing to swim or surf at a beach like this.",

        "review_summary": "Llegamos a la Hacienda La Esperanza alrededor de las 10:30 a.m. (según su sitio web, abren de 8 a.m. a 4 p.m.) este pasado Martes 12 de Febrero y fuimos recibidos por un guardia, quien nos informó que no podían dejarnos entrar ya que no había suficiente personal. Inmediatamente sugirió que regresáramos otro día. Le expliqué que manejamos un poco más de dos horas para llegar allí y que era extremadamente decepcionante que debido a problemas de personal no nos permitieran entrar luego de haber echo tan largo viaje. Pregunté: ¿habrá suficiente personal en el futuro? y su respuesta fue “no podía estar seguro de eso”.\nEstábamos muy entusiasmados con poder visitar la antigua hacienda y su falta de personal/consideración nos arruinó el día. Espero que en un futuro sean más consientes y mantengan sus instalaciones con personal adecuado para poder atender a todo visitante. También les sugiero que si están teniendo dificultades para poder atender el público lo informen en su página web y/o redes sociales para que así todo aquel que esté considerado visitarles tenga esto en mente. De lo contrario les sugiero que no habrán sus puertas.\n\nEnglish translation.\n\nWe arrived at Hacienda La Esperanza around 10:30 a.m. (according to their website, they are open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.) this past Tuesday, February 12, and we were greeted by a guard, who informed us that they could not let us in since there were not enough staff. He immediately suggested we come back another day. I explained that we drove a bit over two hours to get there and that it was extremely disappointing that due to staffing issues we were not allowed in after such a long trip. I asked: will there be enough staff in the future? and his response was “I couldn't be sure of that.”\nWe were very excited to visit the old hacienda and their lack of staff/consideration ruined our day. I hope that in the future they will be considerate and maintain their facilities with adequate staff in order to be able to serve all visitors. I also suggest that if they are having staffing issues, they inform them on their website and/or social media so that everyone who is considering visiting them has this in mind. Otherwise they shouldn’t bother opening their doors.",

        "review_summary": "I asked our guest service rep about public beaches in the area and she recommended Playa Mario, a 25 minute drive from Palmas Del Mar.  the trip to get there was an adventure, up and down mountains on a single lane with \nsharp ess curves.  Once we hit the mountaintop, the view was breathtaking.  Even more spectacular was the fact that shared the whole beach the perhaps three other couples the whole five hours we were there.  Nice palm tree line for shade.  We were a bit disconcerted when we saw a pack of ferrel dogs running along the beach…they were playfully charging at ducks both in and out of the water.  I jumped in the car when they were getting close but they passed by without incident, even with our things sitting on the beach.  Two later came back and slept within two feet of us without coming closer nor looking for pets or food.  A great quiet afternoon.",

The only thing, there's no beach and you have to take a car to get to it. But the west have multiple beaches nearby to choose. The river pool is very nice for all the family.",

I recommend the truffle-buttered rib eye which was cooked correctly and seasoned appropriately. Next time I will definitely try their various cocktails.\n\nI couldn’t recommend this place more!",

This was a family holiday with 2 children 14 & 11.  \n\n**Pros:**\n- VIP package and family suite offered perks like VIP check-in, a la carte room service, and some higher-quality liquor at bars.\n- VIP family suite is nice and big, but dated.\n- Beach and pool were good, though there was limited availability of sunbrellas (they were claimed early in the morning).\n- Restaurants were decent, and nightly shows and animation staff were enjoyable.\n\n**Cons:**\n- Buffet food was rated poorly (2 stars).\n- Only two restaurants open nightly with rotating staff.\n- Resort crowd was older, mostly retired individuals.\n- Limited activities for kids, making it a dull resort overall.\n- Two out of four members of the family got sick (likely from food).\n- Resort became very quiet after 10 PM.",

You can also buy some seeds and feed the birds, fish, and pelicans that are always around the boardwalk grounds. Finish the visit by going up the Guancha Lighthouse and enjoying the view.",

Also an outside room meant incredibly loud street cleaning and water filling for more than an hour at 4:30am.\nThis place needs a major cleaning and update of courtyard furniture that is severely stained.\nHope improvements can happen but would discourage anyone from staying as is.",

Here, you can set off on one of the impressive hiking trails through the undisturbed forest, which leads to an interesting old lighthouse and even a pirates’ cave. You can also book a local boat tour to go snorkeling. This island is a ferry ride away from La Guancha in Ponce.",

It was initially discovered by a charcoal maker from the area, when a large flood in 1975 uncovered the buried remains--which were later shown to be a group of ceremonial plazas and ball fields. Some researchers suggest that, because of their placements, the plazas might have also been used as astral observatories. The largest indigenous cemetery, containing 186 skeletons, was also found. This site is considered to be one of the most important historical and archeological sites in the Antilles.",

Completely refurbished, the turbine is still powered by the water of Río Canas and serves as the main engine for other machines of the time.

No source gave the updates.\nThe complex apparently suffered in 2020 earthquake and is still undergoing repairs. Only 2 floors are accessible to the visitors but they really give the flavor of the museum collections. \nWe were informed that the museum is open on Fridays and on one Saturday a month. We were lucky that it was THAT Saturday. There was no entrance fee. \nThe architecturally beautiful building complex seemed at this point intact again, but they may not fully reopen until 2026.\nThere was an outdoor music concert in front of the museum. The museum gift shop was open. The limited exhibitions were available on the second and third floors.\nFor me this visit was worthwhile. I am looking forward to revisiting this interesting museum when it fully reopens.\nWe were able to leave our donation to the museum and buy some beautiful souvenirs in the store.",

You can also buy some seeds and feed the birds, fish, and pelicans that are always around the boardwalk grounds. Finish the visit by going up the Guancha Lighthouse and enjoying the view.",

If you’re afraid of heights, you may consider skipping this place. (I felt vertigo walking on the bridge and the access is through a glass elevator). \n\nI didn’t see any gift shop or restrooms. Tickets are $15.00 and includes the house tour of Serralles Castle and the Japanese garden.",

You can also buy some seeds and feed the birds, fish, and pelicans that are always around the boardwalk grounds. Finish the visit by going up the Guancha Lighthouse and enjoying the view.",

The stairs going to the beach were broke, and made no attempt to repair them. Not sure if that was a hot tub or just a pool, but the fiberglass was beyond its life expectancy and was flaking off. We had no service for our room the entire week we were there. Even after we asked the front desk to have our room clean. Unfortunately sand tracked in daily.  The doors were a struggle to get in and out of the room and bathroom, paint was peeling in the room. Room was poorly lit and needed phone light at night to see. Went to restaurant 2x for dinner, and was closed both times.  \nAfter looking at the reviews , the rooms have been an ongoing issue for months.",

He said it was normally quite clear. We also did not have the waves he expected or wanted. For a beginner, that was fine. But you could tell he was a bit disappointed in wave quality. But the main thing is that the rocks on shore were a bit of a challenge to navigate carrying a board into the water. And if we did wipe out close to shore then we got a few scrapes on our feet from the rocks.",

However, I have traveled worldwide for work and NEVER arrived at a hotel early to be told that your room is ready but checkin is at 4pm and I can’t give it to you before 2:30pm or it will be an $81 early checkin charge. Also, front desk lady said we could use pool early BUT did not tell us she had towels and had to go back after we got seats! Beautiful beach views!",

        "review_summary": "I was pleasantly surprised by the Hyatt Hacienda del Mar in Dorado, Puerto Rico.\nMy husband and I booked our trip through Expedia and I was reluctant to go to Puerto Rico. I had been to Puerto Rico twice before and the last time, we also stayed in the Dorado area. \n\nI checked the Hyatt website after we booked our trip and the website said there may be noise at the hotel due to construction. I called the hotel and the representative was honest and said that on one side of the hotel, there is demolition occurring and there may be noise during day hours but it is not every day and not so bad. At this point, it did not matter because our stay was already booked.\n\nThe size of the hotel is perfect. It is not huge so that one has to walk a lot and yet it is spacious. The property has beautiful grounds which include a tennis court and basketball court (by the parking lot, across the road from the main entrance). Parking is spacious and FREE which was a big plus for us since we rented a car this trip. The pool at the hotel has 8 laps (a must for my husband who loves to swim) and extends to an additional swimming area and another smaller pool (for babies and kids). There are two hot tubs (one on each side of the pool area). \nThere are plenty pool chairs and seating areas. The landscaping is magnificent with palm trees surrounding the pool area. As far as hotel activities, there is bingo and meditation and other activities varying by day. The hotel grounds have a small soccer area and volleyball area and two bbq grills. The clubhouse has a game room for kids with air hockey, a pool table and other games. The gym is well stocked with lots of equipment and is open 24 hours a day (just use your room card).\nThe pool hours are until 10 pm and the pool is well lit at night.\n\nThe beach is private and magnificent. The hotel room we were given was a corner unit with a full kitchen, huge balcony and had views of both the pool and ocean.\nThe staff was amazing and super helpful and friendly. There is a small bar/restaurant (not formal) that is privately owned - just right for cocktails and drinks and light meals.\n\nI highly recommend the Hyatt Hacienda del Mar. I hope to return soon. The hotel completely changed my views regarding Puerto Rico. It is definitely worth a visit!",

I did not visit the houses this time, only the main visitor's area. A place of peace and nature. Bring your binoculars if you're a bird fan. Not many places in Puerto Rico can take you so deep in a forest.\nBe patient and careful on the street in and out. It is very narrow. There is no cell phone signal at all, so bring your two way radios and inform your family you will be out of the radar.\nOther than that, visit and enjoy. Please bring all that you need before arriving.",

While swimming isn't encouraged (powerful rip tides are common here), you can still lounge by the beach and watch surfers, boogie boarders, and parasailers ride the currents. There are also recreational areas like Ventana al Mar where you can take part in an outdoor yoga session or some aqua fitness. Drop by the beach on a city tour of San Juan, which often includes a stop here. – Tripadvisor",

For people into History, there is a lot of information about the history of Puerto Rico. The Wikipedia page speaks of antique gun shooting which would have been fascinating to watch but we were not there on a 3rd sunday",

        "description": "An esplanade greets you as you walk towards the Fort San Felipe del Morro. Surrounded by grassy hills, the stone castle rises majestically from the headland. And while El Morro may be an impressive sight from land, it is a terrifying experience to encounter it head on by sea. And for many attackers, it was the very last thing they saw. This fortress has seen many battles over the centuries, from Sir Francis Drake's attack in 1595 to the 1898 Bombardment of San Juan by the US Navy. In 1539 King Charles I ordered the construction of San Felipe del Morro and other fortifications on the islet of San Juan. Over the years, Spanish, Italian, Irish and American engineers perfected San Juan's defense system, of which el Morro was an essential part. After crossing the stone bridge over the dry moat, you'll walk right into a spacious courtyard that harbor leads you into the castle's more \"domestic\" areas, such as the kitchen and the chapel. Nevertheless, this is just one of the six levels that form el Morro. On the upper level, you'll find the lighthouse that was restored by the American Coast Guard in 1908. One of the greatest things about this vantage point is that you can see most of San Juan and the bay across from it. Park rangers will guide you throughout the massive fortification, which still houses original cannons, ammunition, and many other objects used by the Spanish militia in Puerto Rico. El Morro was declared a World Heritage Site by UNESCO in 1983, and is currently under the administration of the National Park Service.",

The views out-to-sea & inland on all sides of the fort are magnificent.\n\nWalk round the perimiter of the outside edge of the fort to see the igarnos and then decend to sea-level to walk the concrete prominade path. It's abosolutley lovely.\n\nThe gift shop is expensive, wait until you get back to the quayside to buy your souvenirs.",

Here, you can roam the cobblestoned pathways, admire the colonial-era buildings, and do a little bit of shopping for souvenirs and handicrafts. For a little more history, you can join a guided tour of La Fortaleza, the governor’s official mansion that's just around the corner. And don't leave without snapping a picture of the colorful canopy—it changes throughout the year so you can always look forward to something new. The alley can get busy so come early in the morning when it’s quieter. You can visit on a walking or segway tour of Old San Juan, which often makes a stop here. – Tripadvisor",

All the beautiful pastel buildings were picturesque.  It was near the pigeon plaza too, so we enjoyed the birds.  We had done research that said Old San Juan was a cab drive from the cruise port, but honestly we (family of five with kids ages 19, 22, and 24) walked through the city from the cruise port seeing different shops, streets, plazas, etc. until we reached the fort on the upper side.  It was not hard to walk and we enjoyed the views along the way, stopping for photos or ducking into shops.  After our walk, we ate lunch at La Verguenza for lunch on the roof and they truly had the best empanadas I've ever had and the drinks and steak churasco were fantastic too - just a short walk from Calle De La Fortaleza.  Made for a nice day!",

Although the bill was passed and a neoclassical design had been chosen, the construction of the Capitol encountered several fiscal, economic and political difficulties which resulted in the work being suspended twice. Despite all difficulties encountered throughout the years, the Capitol building was finally inaugurated on February 11, 1929.\nOn June 30, 1977, the Capitol of Puerto Rico was designated a Historic Landmark and on November 18, 1977, it was listed on the United States National Register of Historic Places.",

        "review_summary": "The real value of a walk through Old San Juan is seeing the cross-section of a variety of ways of life.  You have some Spanish history mixed with almost a New Orleans' style architecture.  This is then mixed with the destruction wrought by multiple hurricanes and the lack of funds to do proper repairs.  Then add the tourist vibe, heavily emphasizing either fast food type chains, t-shirt and jewelry places, and tobacco-type shops.  Not exactly clean streets, but fascinating for people-watching.  Last, and rather sad really, you see some of the poverty that seems common amongst peoples living in warm island climates.  Not unique to the world, but perhaps to a U.S. territory.  For those who want some taste of internationalism but still want to pay for goods in USD, it's a unique place to take a stroll through.",

        "review_summary": "The hotel is beautiful. You’re presented with such a beautiful smell on entry. The winding stairs and the ocean view in the distance secures your vacation mode. We were booked to stay Thursday - Sunday. However, that first impression was immediately disrupted by my welcoming. \n1. Thursday - There was quite a wait to check in given that our check in was 4p and it was after 4p. I was greeted with kindness, but did not receive the same welcome to my right and left. I booked the 2 bedroom suite and was told that one of my rooms was available. She mentioned that I would receive a phone call when my other room was available. I gave a card for a $600 incidentals hold. She gave me one wristband (key), and didn’t offer any more (5 ppl were staying in the suite). I asked for one additional key. She then pushed the welcome letter to me stating that this is our welcome letter. I clearly saw the other two guests getting a full layout of the welcome letter with traffic control-like directions to where the amenities were. Also, we were not offered any assistance with our luggage, whereas the other two guest were. The double queen room was nice, and the city view was beautiful. The entry way door looked to have been kicked in, so I made sure to notify the front desk via phone call. We went to OSJ, and I never received a phone call that the room was ready. We stayed out past 9p. When asked when was the room ready, I was told 6:15. The king bedroom was incredible. We had two balconies. One facing the city and one facing the ocean. We were there celebrating my birthday so 2 bottles of champagne were waiting for us, which I believe was courtesy of my travel agent suggesting that it was birthday. The door wasn’t fixed so we slept with both inside doors latched and locked. \n2. Friday - No one came to check on the door last night nor the morning, so I mentioned it to the front desk before we left for the day. Came back late afternoon and spoke to Alejandro about the door and he said he’d have someone take a look. No one came the entire day. \n3. Saturday - Still no fix to the door. Went out early morning and received a text at 1:38, PR time, from Krystal, our supposed butler stating “don’t hesitate to contact me if you need anything.” That was the first I’d heard from her the entire trip. A HUGE disappointment!!!!! I spoke to Alejandro on arrival back to the hotel. He reported that a butler should have been waiting for us at check in, checking in with shift changes, and provided contact information. I received NONE of that until Saturday afternoon. I also reminded him of the door that no one had fixed. Alejandro gave apologies, offered at $400 credit, and said he would send someone up. The service guys came up to fix the door at 7:37p and we were sent bottles of champagne at 7:44p and 7:50p. The guys “fixed” the door but did not fix the latch, which was loose at the top, so I called them back to fix that. I was unaware at the time, but when my sister went to lock the lock on that door when we were going to bed, it wouldn’t even lock!!! \n4. Sunday - I asked for a late check out (12p vs 1p) given that our room wasn’t ready on arrival, and the front desk lady (blanking on her name but I believe it started with a G) approved the request, said she’d have a bell hop gather our luggage 15 minutes before that so it will already be downstairs waiting for us, and suggested we go to Pannes for brunch. Very sweet and accommodating. We put all of our luggage in the doorway. Walked the east wing for the first time and found that there was a rooftop, bigger pool, an infinity pool, and a restaurant on the east wing of the hotel. Granted we could have found it on our own, but this is something I could have been made aware of with a FULL discussion of the welcome letter. Nonetheless, our luggage was still in our room when we came back upstairs for a quick room sweep for any left items. Our driver arrived at 1250 so everyone went to the van, while I checked out. At check out, with Leena, I briefly told her about the many disappointments of our stay, and asked for a copy of the $400 credit to ensure it would be put back on my card. I mentioned that the driver was waiting on me to take us back to the airport. She took at least 3-5 minutes to return. Mind you, two people checked out quickly and were told they’d receive an emailed copy of their receipt. Leena came back and said that the $600 hold was not charged, and the $400 credit was applied. However, I owed $218 worth of tariffs for the stay. I was charged $197, $210, and $210 daily for our stay. Apparently, the tariffs are the hotel taxes and gratuity, which the 20% gratuity was NOT worth it because we didn’t receive the treatment that came with the room. Heavily disappointed, yet again, because this is something that I should have been made aware of at check-in!!!  I did not have enough time to discuss the charge further because our driver was pushing us to leave. \nAgain, the hotel is beautiful. The common areas are modernized. The turndown service was great. The staff, at face value, have immaculate customer service, but there’s a lack communication to certain guests of amenities and amongst staff, AND the follow-through is an after thought. We were a group of people of color (POC), from the states, and one of very few groups of POC seen on site the entire stay. The blatant DISCRIMINATION was subtle and loud all in the same breath. We found that discrimination against African Americans was isolated to the Condado area. I expected the red carpet to be rolled out being that we were in a suite with a butler, as advertised on the website, and that it was my birthday celebration. All I expected in return was genuine communication and apology, follow-through, and what we paid for. Yet, that was far from the case. We were given false information, subpar treatment from non-POC counterparts, and bottles of champagne. I did not associate our treatment here with all of San Juan, because we had an incredible time, and encounter genuinely wonderful people elsewhere, so I will revisit the island. Thus, I would NEVER recommend this place to anyone nor stay here again, which would most likely be fine for this company.",

        "review_summary": "So it's a mess of so many problems.  Check in was easy.  We got to our 'suite' which started the mess.  Turns out they have a very limited number of 'suites', i.e. a separate bedroom from the tv / entry area, so what they advertise as a suite is just a larger than a standard room.  Also, very few rooms have a direct ocean view, so they consider any slice of a view of the water as an \"ocean view\".  It's really false advertising.  Within the room, there's minimal overhead lighting.  One side of the bed has no outlets, so it's annoying for two people to charge their phones overnight.  Downstairs, they offer multiple 'restaurants', but each has a very small footprint with highly overpriced bland food, i.e. no brand-name restaurants on property like the other local hotels offer.  So please just walk down the street (or get a ubiquitous uber) for meals.  Grocery stores are nearby as well.  The only exception (and the reason they get two instead of one star) is breakfast.  Really nice spread of options, all included for gold and above level members.  The gym is very strange, as it seems to be open to memberships so it was full of bodybuilders that are intimidating to weekend warrior hotel guests.  The spa is very small, limited rooms with some cleanliness issues, and limited treatment options.  You pay some exorbitant 'resort' fee of $65 per day for internet (you should get for free) and to play tennis for an hour, though no one seemed to be playing.  Towels are locked up because they don't trust you (and I guess $65 per day per room isn't enough to replace lost towels).  Bottom line, not in a 1000 years would I ever think of returning here if it was a stateside hotel.  Even if I was headed back to PR, I'd think of avoiding marriott just to never set foot in this hotel again.",

The central area has towers decorated with mosaics. The other area has a large pool that's decorated with mosaics and has water spouts. Amidst the other attractions, there is an elevated route where you can walk among trees and enjoy a view atop the park. One of the favorite areas for older attendees has an enormous spider that is larger than 20 feet of height. There are two areas for pets. There are various areas for children to play football. There is a mini field available for football players. If you enjoy walking through open and natural spaces, the park is surrounded by modern sidewalks and colorful seats. -ZeePuertoRico",

I went for the doggie areas, which are great, they have two smaller closed areas and one big one with benches big trees and doggie obstacles. There is a park attendant in the entrance of the larger doggie park keeping and eye on the area. Lots of staff working all around the park which is great too.

There are also several museums where you can learn more about the history, art, and culture of the area, plus cool cocktail bars and restaurants for a quintessentially Puerto Rican meal.

        "review_summary": "The real value of a walk through Old San Juan is seeing the cross-section of a variety of ways of life.  You have some Spanish history mixed with almost a New Orleans' style architecture.  This is then mixed with the destruction wrought by multiple hurricanes and the lack of funds to do proper repairs.  Then add the tourist vibe, heavily emphasizing either fast food type chains, t-shirt and jewelry places, and tobacco-type shops.  Not exactly clean streets, but fascinating for people-watching.  Last, and rather sad really, you see some of the poverty that seems common amongst peoples living in warm island climates.  Not unique to the world, but perhaps to a U.S. territory.  For those who want some taste of internationalism but still want to pay for goods in USD, it's a unique place to take a stroll through.",

The rodaballo was cooked to perfection, and the gambas, swordfish, and ahi tuna were equally outstanding—each dish offering something unique. The service by Jimmy and Berto was truly exceptional.\n\nYou don’t have to go to San Juan to enjoy a fine dining experience on par with Ariel or El Chotis. The ambiance was further elevated by the gentle strains of classical guitar and the soulful harmonies of the “trios” playing softly in the background.\n\nA remarkable dining experience—highly recommended!",

With their milky appearance and lush green surroundings, the waterfalls are a picturesque sight. The natural pools formed by the waterfalls are perfect for taking a dip, swimming with small fishes, and enjoying the summer heat. Kids will love jumping off the boulders and trying out the rope swing, while younger children can safely play in the shallow areas of the pools. Don't forget to check out the small underwater cave too. You can visit the waterfalls on a full-day tour from San Juan. – Tripadvisor",

The service by Jimmy and Berto was truly exceptional.\n\nYou don’t have to go to San Juan to enjoy a fine dining experience on par with Ariel or El Chotis. The ambiance was further elevated by the gentle strains of classical guitar and the soulful harmonies of the “trios” playing softly in the background.\n\nA remarkable dining experience—highly recommended!",

The rodaballo was cooked to perfection, and the gambas, swordfish, and ahi tuna were equally outstanding—each dish offering something unique. The service by Jimmy and Berto was truly exceptional.\n\nYou don’t have to go to San Juan to enjoy a fine dining experience on par with Ariel or El Chotis. The ambiance was further elevated by the gentle strains of classical guitar and the soulful harmonies of the “trios” playing softly in the background.\n\nA remarkable dining experience—highly recommended!",

It was initially discovered by a charcoal maker from the area, when a large flood in 1975 uncovered the buried remains--which were later shown to be a group of ceremonial plazas and ball fields. Some researchers suggest that, because of their placements, the plazas might have also been used as astral observatories. The largest indigenous cemetery, containing 186 skeletons, was also found. This site is considered to be one of the most important historical and archeological sites in the Antilles.",

Inmediatamente sugirió que regresáramos otro día. Le expliqué que manejamos un poco más de dos horas para llegar allí y que era extremadamente decepcionante que debido a problemas de personal no nos permitieran entrar luego de haber echo tan largo viaje. Pregunté: ¿habrá suficiente personal en el futuro? y su respuesta fue “no podía estar seguro de eso”.\nEstábamos muy entusiasmados con poder visitar la antigua hacienda y su falta de personal/consideración nos arruinó el día. Espero que en un futuro sean más consientes y mantengan sus instalaciones con personal adecuado para poder atender a todo visitante. También les sugiero que si están teniendo dificultades para poder atender el público lo informen en su página web y/o redes sociales para que así todo aquel que esté considerado visitarles tenga esto en mente. De lo contrario les sugiero que no habrán sus puertas.\n\nEnglish translation.\n\nWe arrived at Hacienda La Esperanza around 10:30 a.m. (according to their website, they are open from 8 a.m. to 4 p.m.) this past Tuesday, February 12, and we were greeted by a guard, who informed us that they could not let us in since there were not enough staff. He immediately suggested we come back another day. I explained that we drove a bit over two hours to get there and that it was extremely disappointing that due to staffing issues we were not allowed in after such a long trip. I asked: will there be enough staff in the future? and his response was “I couldn't be sure of that.”\nWe were very excited to visit the old hacienda and their lack of staff/consideration ruined our day. I hope that in the future they will be considerate and maintain their facilities with adequate staff in order to be able to serve all visitors. I also suggest that if they are having staffing issues, they inform them on their website and/or social media so that everyone who is considering visiting them has this in mind. Otherwise they shouldn’t bother opening their doors.",

        "review_summary": "The views are amazing!! This is more of a getaway, secluded romantic vacation.  If you’re looking to party and the beach and what not then this is not the island to go to.  Also, since it’s an island plan to travel almost half the day to the resort!! there’s only I believe two or three taxis on the island. It takes 30 minutes to get to one side of the island and the other. But when you land at the airport, it’s an hour taxi or Uber ride to the ferry, which where you have to wait with a bunch of people who actually live there! They speak a lot of Spanish so I would suggest learning some Spanish…. Especially when you take the 30 minute ferry ride to the island then people really only speak Spanish. You run into a few Americans obviously. However, that is their language!! it’s a beautiful island. The resort I stayed at, had wild horses just walking around, an infinity pool, the horses were not mean at all. I literally have videos of me petting one, although I suggest to be careful. \nIt’s about a 15 minute walk to the black sand beach. Again, I’m speaking of the resort I stayed at. And we each had our own little bungalow. I would’ve gave this hotel 10 stars or the island 10 stars but everything closes early around 3 to 4 PM and I’m talking like grocery stores. There’s not many there. They’re more like little gas stations. But they have the necessities water milk you know stuff like that. There was a few bars that were open late Ish. The normal hours to midnight or two … also like any trip make sure you book any events ahead of time! :-) as they were completely out of every single thing to do on my birthday!!! They wouldn’t even do anything so that was pretty upsetting. And that was the entire island I called.",

You’ll marvel at the neon blue trail left by microorganisms whenever they are disturbed—just dip your hands in the water and watch the effects. Visit on a dark night (e.g. during a new moon) to ensure peak visibility of the phenomenon.",

If you want to experience the land, the beach, the sea...just as it IS...this is the place. We took our rental Jeep back the windy road and spread our towels under the coconut trees and enjoyed a beach without another human in sight or hearing. Just us and Mother Nature. It is a top ten highlight of my life, truly. Just the most natural and peaceful setting.",

Keep an eye out for the playful feral horses that gallop along the dunes, or visit the stately ceiba tree that’s been keeping watch over the highland for three centuries. ",

When we arrived we ordered 2 soups and some wings (both were very good). The waitress went to ask what we wanted for the main dish. When we finished the soups, we asked about the wings and she told us they were about to come out. After a loooong wait, when she only brought my main dish, I told her to forget about the wings, that we were going to wait for my husband’s main dish. Long story short: They served the table next to us before us, I finished my dish, and after about 10-15 minutes the waitress brought the wings, even though I had told her to cancel them, she didn’t listen to us. About 10 minutes later my husband’s dish arrived. The service was a DISASTER… it’s a shame that such a nice place, with young and enterprising owners, falls apart due to poor service to their customers.",

And if you have a little children, there is a natural shallow pool area at the far end.",

When we arrived we ordered 2 soups and some wings (both were very good). The waitress went to ask what we wanted for the main dish. When we finished the soups, we asked about the wings and she told us they were about to come out. After a loooong wait, when she only brought my main dish, I told her to forget about the wings, that we were going to wait for my husband’s main dish. Long story short: They served the table next to us before us, I finished my dish, and after about 10-15 minutes the waitress brought the wings, even though I had told her to cancel them, she didn’t listen to us. About 10 minutes later my husband’s dish arrived. The service was a DISASTER… it’s a shame that such a nice place, with young and enterprising owners, falls apart due to poor service to their customers.",

Hike the massive El Yunque rainforest to see waterfalls, stone towers, and colorful Puerto Rican wildlife. As far as beaches go, it doesn’t get better than the private sands of Isla de Vieques – particularly Mosquito Bay, where by moonlight the water glows blue-green thanks to magical microorganisms.",

Although there are no signs to direct you to the entrance to the trail, the google map puts you at a roadside restaurant where you can park and have a bite or a drink before you enter.  Just cross the road to a slight incline which is the start of the trail.   Surprisingly, when we went on a Wednesday afternoon, the trail and the bridge were eerily deserted.  So we had the site to ouselves.   The bridge is all metal construction, even though it looks to be wooden in photos..  It is suspended with metal cables, which are worn through in some spot.  It is still sturdy enough,  with the worn spots adding to the adrenalin experience.",

The park was closed and the guard at the closed gate told us that it has been closed for 4 months until further notice. It is not allowed to enter neither the park nor the caves. There were dozens of cars which stopped at the gate while we were there only to leave in disappointment. We were standing near the gate for more than an hour researching if there was any other way to see the caves (with some tour or by entering through a different entrance to the caves). Unfortunately, no web-site states that the park is closed and the tour pages just say that their activity is not available at this time. So, it is not communicated to the public that one cannot visit the caves at this time. This is sad since quite a lot of people are likely visiting Puerto Rico to see the caves and consider them as one of the island's main attractions, as it was in our case.",

Our server Jeriel was so attentive and kind, he made sure everything was to our liking and gave excellent service.

It used to be called Balneario Isla Verde, so some people might still refer to it as that.  “Balneario” is a government-run beach, which is maintained, have restrooms, lifeguards, a fenced parking lot, and other facilities to make your day at the beach both pleasant and safe.  This review is not about the beach that runs in front of the fancy hotels. \n\nJust like the description, this beach is a long stretch of white sand just outside of San Juan, so there is plenty of room to spread out.  For a view, you can see the “skyline”  of Isla Verde to the west.  It’s very pretty. I went on a weekend and there was facilities including showers, lifeguards, bathrooms, food kiosks, and a couple of places that rented chairs and umbrellas, and water sports equipment. \n\n Parking was $5.00 cash only. Just keep in mind that the parking closes at 6:00 pm sharp, so at 5:00 the municipal police will start to get the people out of the water. But, if you are looking for a nice light sand beach close to San Juan this is a good option.",

        "review_summary": "Don Juan Santos Torres is an inspiring figure, showcasing how passion and creativity can transform a lifetime of work into something extraordinary. Known as “The Flintstones of Guavate,” he turned his retirement into a vibrant new chapter, dedicating himself to crafting remarkable sculptures that reflect his artistry and cultural pride. His \"sacred mountain\" in Guavate, Puerto Rico, is home to his most iconic work: towering statues of the Three Wise Men, standing at an impressive 33 feet tall and visible from the Luis A. Ferré Highway.\n\nThese sculptures are not just an artistic marvel but also a testament to his devotion to preserving Puerto Rican traditions and history. By trading construction tools for his creative pursuits, Don Juan has left a legacy that will inspire future generations. \n\nDon Juan's work is full of cultural and personal significance, so learning more about his story would only make the experience richer. His journey from construction worker to an artist is deeply tied to his love for Puerto Rican traditions.\n\nHe reportedly began sculpting as a way to give back to his community and honor the heritage of Guavate. The Three Wise Men, or Los Tres Reyes Magos, are central figures in Puerto Rican culture, especially celebrated during Día de Reyes (Three Kings Day). By creating these monumental statues, Don Juan not only highlighted this tradition but also ensured it would have a lasting, visual presence for all who pass by.",

        "review_summary": "This place is changing a bit, and not for the better, but it remains a happy place for me. The main pain point for me is that it's supposed to be in a Reserve, meaning a quiet place where you can feel free. Dorado is getting overdeveloped, and you can't walk or bicycle along a road for ten seconds without having a car in your way. It's worse than many residential neighborhoods back at home. They are building many more condos and thinking of building a JW Marriott hotel which will be large and probably turn the area into a circus.\nHere's a list of things the hotel you used to provide that it no longer does: hammocks at the pool, snacks in the gym, foam rollers in the gym, little bottles of sunscreen, dishes by the outdoor showers in your room with amenities such as soap and shampoo. I wish they would bring back the breakfast buffet. I found that sending a pre-order through my butler helped speed up breakfast although I still had to wait 15 minutes for my food to be brought to the table. I figure it's only a matter of time before they phase out the popsicles you get upon arrival.\nThe Spa Botanico remains a wonderful spa but do you think that $375 for a one hour massage might be a bit steep?\nI prefer the upstairs rooms because you have more privacy instead of everyone walking by and looking at you in your room. \nAmex Platinum gives you a \"property credit\" and you figure that you can use it at the spa or at the restaurant at Encanto beach club. You can't. The credit is only good for the 2 hotel restaurants and room service. They have a promotion giving out $500 property credits for 2 night stays and I\"m wondering where anyone is supposed to spend the credits except at the two restaurants. \nAll in all, a room here costs about $3,000 a night, which is about the same as a junior suite at the Cheval Blanc in Paris. That's probably a good comparison and along those lines, the price is right. What you do get here is AC in your room that works and stays on all night, fruit and treats in your room upon arrival, electricity that doesn't go out when the rest of the island does, a beautiful pool area with a heated pool and a jacuzzi with a pretty ocean view, butler service, a calm beach for swimming due to the breakers (which is very hard to find anywhere else), a good 24 hour fitness facility, a water park with 2 slides and a lazy river,  a decent gym that also makes good smoothies, bicycles, probably the best food on the island, and a gated community with very upscale living 35 minutes from an airport with lots of flights at good prices.",

While it might be okay for a weekend getaway, it’s not comfortable for extended stays, as we found ourselves rummaging through our suitcases.\n\nThe fire alarm goes off frequently due to people smoking in a non-smoking area. It typically goes off after 11 p.m.\n\nThe pictures don’t accurately represent the size of the rooms and bathrooms. Everything is smaller than you’d expect.\n\nSwimming in the ocean is not recommended at this resort because it’s rocky and has a strong undertow. There is a beach area where you can relax if you’d like.\n\nOne thing we truly enjoyed was the incredible bed and sheets.\n\nIf you rent a car, be prepared to pay $30 per day for In-N-Out privileges and there’s a valet service.\n\nAdditionally, there’s a $65 daily tourist tax that we were surprised to encounter when checking out.\n\nThe food at their restaurants was generally good.",

The beach is great with a few little covered picnic tables and a large protected pool for swimming. There were some waves but it was safe for kids and we saw a few people snorkeling. Not a lot of shade though so plan accordingly for that. No permanent bathrooms but when we were there they had portapotty. Kind of a lot of trash in the parking area but the beach was clean.",

We didn’t get rid of that during our stay. The bed was so wet it sticked to our skin. The Hotel in general wasn’t really clean. The food was average, the tables and chairs outside were dirty from the birds and the chairs haven’t been cleaned. For some days the area outside was closed due to a sports event, which was also very unfortunate. We then had to have breakfast inside where the air conditioner freezed us :/",

The  main courses were good but not great. The fried red snapper was a little over done but the skin was salty and nicely crisp. The grouper was nicely cooked and very tasty. The sides were wanting. Too much rice and slightly watery beans.\nWe would go again for drinks and appetizers and choose different sides with the main courses. It’s worth going for the fine service.",

There is music, and there is marijuana (we were there Saturday and Sunday so maybe got the weekend crowd?). Do not expect a resort experience.  Take the bad reviews with a grain of salt.  It cost us $4 to park, $35 to rent two chairs and an umbrella for the day, and $2 per person for the bathroom/changing/shower facilities.  The bathrooms were on par with most public bathrooms at beaches in the US I have been to.  One perk was they actually had staff going through and doing spot check cleaning.  The water at the beach was lovely and calm. If you walk the 5-10 minutes to the kiosks- expect a rowdier experience.  Lots of fun food and drink options but it was dirtier (lots of garbage laying around) and louder (music blaring from cars).  The paid public parking section is the way to go.  All the vendors and employees spoke English and were super friendly!  Several food options on this end of the beach also.  Highly recommend and would go back in a heartbeat!",

        "review_summary": "This is our review of the Forest Service Headquarters located in the Maricao Forest Preserve at the 16.1km marker on highway PR-120.\nI would think this location is primarily of interest for birders, as several local endemics are present.\nThe entrance road turns off PR-120 and parallels it for awhile before it comes to an open area that has picnic shelters (pretty run down) and bathrooms that are locked when we were there. A gate keeps you out of the actual HQ buildings where people are working. For birding, the road in is worth walking and they've lined the road with benches for you to sit and let the birds show up.\nThere is parking near the bathrooms, but you can also continue up to the overlook (Banco Solitario) although there are some deep holes that make it somewhat hard to turn around. The overlook has two benches, giving you options for shade, and the view is wonderful for a picnic or rest.\nBehind the bench across the road, there is a very short, straight trail that is worth birding.\nThe road winds up past electrical transformers and ends at a gate. You can walk past the gate and should, as it goes up to an old stone house (Casa De Piedra) in another clearing. A trail keeps going past the house and if you take the right hand path, it seems to go downhill a lot. There are nature info signs that seem new. Not knowing where this trail went (there are no maps), we were a little worried we'd have to backtrack and climb back up, but somehow magically we came out just a little below the lookout benches on the road up to them. This apparently is called the \"old jeep road\", and you'll notice the other end on the way up to the lookout, on your right behind a yellow gate.  Actually a nice trail.\nThe left hand trail I've read follows a powerline cut that goes upward and rejoins PR-120 at KM 15.3.",

Once we hit the mountaintop, the view was breathtaking.  Even more spectacular was the fact that shared the whole beach the perhaps three other couples the whole five hours we were there.  Nice palm tree line for shade.  We were a bit disconcerted when we saw a pack of ferrel dogs running along the beach…they were playfully charging at ducks both in and out of the water.  I jumped in the car when they were getting close but they passed by without incident, even with our things sitting on the beach.  Two later came back and slept within two feet of us without coming closer nor looking for pets or food.  A great quiet afternoon.",

To begin with the carucho was extremely soft as if it had been stewed, a horrible texture and it had almost no taste and it was thrown on top of the mofongo and when we opened up the order to eat we found an extremely oily and mixed mess. The accompanying salads in both orders had black rot ( lettuce). Oil everywhere maybe they use soybean oil, it's a lot cheaper, who knows. The chillo was a bit better but the mofongo was extremely soft, no taste and oily  The trip was only an eight minute drive back. It was a recommended place but we will not buy (spend money ) there again or recommend it. We love seafood and we know seafood.",

The stairs going to the beach were broke, and made no attempt to repair them. Not sure if that was a hot tub or just a pool, but the fiberglass was beyond its life expectancy and was flaking off. We had no service for our room the entire week we were there. Even after we asked the front desk to have our room clean. Unfortunately sand tracked in daily.  The doors were a struggle to get in and out of the room and bathroom, paint was peeling in the room. Room was poorly lit and needed phone light at night to see. Went to restaurant 2x for dinner, and was closed both times.  \nAfter looking at the reviews , the rooms have been an ongoing issue for months.",

Also, front desk lady said we could use pool early BUT did not tell us she had towels and had to go back after we got seats! Beautiful beach views!",

        "review_summary": "The real value of a walk through Old San Juan is seeing the cross-section of a variety of ways of life.  You have some Spanish history mixed with almost a New Orleans' style architecture.  This is then mixed with the destruction wrought by multiple hurricanes and the lack of funds to do proper repairs.  Then add the tourist vibe, heavily emphasizing either fast food type chains, t-shirt and jewelry places, and tobacco-type shops.  Not exactly clean streets, but fascinating for people-watching.  Last, and rather sad really, you see some of the poverty that seems common amongst peoples living in warm island climates.  Not unique to the world, but perhaps to a U.S. territory.  For those who want some taste of internationalism but still want to pay for goods in USD, it's a unique place to take a stroll through.",

The rodaballo was cooked to perfection, and the gambas, swordfish, and ahi tuna were equally outstanding—each dish offering something unique. The service by Jimmy and Berto was truly exceptional.\n\nYou don’t have to go to San Juan to enjoy a fine dining experience on par with Ariel or El Chotis. The ambiance was further elevated by the gentle strains of classical guitar and the soulful harmonies of the “trios” playing softly in the background.\n\nA remarkable dining experience—highly recommended!",

Also, since it’s an island plan to travel almost half the day to the resort!! there’s only I believe two or three taxis on the island. It takes 30 minutes to get to one side of the island and the other. But when you land at the airport, it’s an hour taxi or Uber ride to the ferry, which where you have to wait with a bunch of people who actually live there! They speak a lot of Spanish so I would suggest learning some Spanish…. Especially when you take the 30 minute ferry ride to the island then people really only speak Spanish. You run into a few Americans obviously. However, that is their language!! it’s a beautiful island. The resort I stayed at, had wild horses just walking around, an infinity pool, the horses were not mean at all. I literally have videos of me petting one, although I suggest to be careful. \nIt’s about a 15 minute walk to the black sand beach. Again, I’m speaking of the resort I stayed at. And we each had our own little bungalow. I would’ve gave this hotel 10 stars or the island 10 stars but everything closes early around 3 to 4 PM and I’m talking like grocery stores. There’s not many there. They’re more like little gas stations. But they have the necessities water milk you know stuff like that. There was a few bars that were open late Ish. The normal hours to midnight or two … also like any trip make sure you book any events ahead of time! :-) as they were completely out of every single thing to do on my birthday!!! They wouldn’t even do anything so that was pretty upsetting. And that was the entire island I called.",

        "review_summary": "We have been there several times and it has always been great until yesterday… the service was HORRIBLE. When we arrived we ordered 2 soups and some wings (both were very good). The waitress went to ask what we wanted for the main dish. When we finished the soups, we asked about the wings and she told us they were about to come out. After a loooong wait, when she only brought my main dish, I told her to forget about the wings, that we were going to wait for my husband’s main dish. Long story short: They served the table next to us before us, I finished my dish, and after about 10-15 minutes the waitress brought the wings, even though I had told her to cancel them, she didn’t listen to us. About 10 minutes later my husband’s dish arrived. The service was a DISASTER… it’s a shame that such a nice place, with young and enterprising owners, falls apart due to poor service to their customers.",

The brownie dessert with Ice cream was one of the best brownies I have ever had! Coffee and drinks were excellent as well. Tostones were cooked beautifully. And the servers were attentive and very warm and friendly. Best food for the price around!",
