In 1935, the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (Spanish: Administracion de Reconstruccion de Puerto Rico ) acquired 3,500 acres in and around Monte Guilarte in the municipality of Adjuntas with the goal of preserving the area as a forest reserve. The reserve was intended to be a wildlife preserve for the conservation of numerous plant and animal species found in the area but also for recreational purposes. Today the forest is managed by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA), which has enlarged the protected area of the forest which now extends 4,822 acres.",

Located about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami , Florida , between the Dominican Republic in the Greater Antilles and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Lesser Antilles , it consists of the eponymous main island and numerous smaller islands, including Vieques , Culebra , and Mona . With approximately 3.2 million residents , it is divided into 78 municipalities , of which the most populous is the capital municipality of San Juan , followed by those within the San Juan metropolitan area . Spanish and English are the official languages of the government , though Spanish predominates.  Puerto Rico was settled by a succession of Amerindian peoples beginning 2,000 to 4,000 years ago; these included the Ortoiroid , Saladoid , and Taino . It was claimed by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 and subsequently colonized by Juan Ponce de Leon in 1508. Puerto Rico was contested by other European powers into the 18th century but remained a Spanish possession for the next 400 years. The decline of the indigenous population , followed by an influx of Spanish settlers, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia , and African slaves vastly changed the cultural and demographic landscape of the archipelago. Within the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategically significant role compared to larger and wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . By the late 19th century, a distinct Puerto Rican identity began to emerge, centered around a fusion of European , African , and indigenous elements. In 1898, following the Spanish\u2013American War , Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States .",

In 1917, the U.S Congress provided funding for a new lighthouse in higher ground.

Construction on the new lighthouse was completed in 1922. The light is active aid to navigation and is a housing facility for the United States Coast Guard .",

        "content": "San Cristobal Canyon ( Spanish : Canon de San Cristobal ) is a canyon carved by the Usabon River , located on the town boundary between the municipalities of Barranquitas and Aibonito in the central region of the main island of Puerto Rico . Situated between the mountain subranges of Cordillera Central and Sierra de Cayey , San Cristobal measures 9 kilometers (5.5 mi) in length and reaches up to 750 feet (228.6 m) in depth, making it the deepest land canyon in Puerto Rico and the West Indies in the Caribbean . Home to some of the tallest waterfalls and hundreds of species of flora and fauna in the island, the canyon is government-protected as a natural area since 1978, which came after the site was used as a land fill from 1954 to 1974. San Cristobal and its northerly neighbor of Las Bocas Canyon are part of a larger canyon system belonging to the La Plata River basin in the central mountainous region of Puerto Rico.  The San Cristobal Canyon is mainly carved by the flow of the Usabon River , an eastward tributary of the La Plata River ( Rio de la Plata ), which at approximately 46 miles (74 km) is the longest river in Puerto Rico. The river flow of the Usabon is fed by numerous tributaries, particularly the Aibonito and Barranquitas Rivers, which flow from the south and north of the canyon, respectively. These rivers are named after the municipalities they originate from, to which the Usabon functions as a natural municipal boundary. This river system, along with its wider hydrological basin of La Plata, have sculpted the canyonlands of the eastern Cordillera Central of Puerto Rico. This process has created numerous waterfalls, some of which are the tallest in Puerto Rico. For example, La Vaca Falls ( Salto La Vaca ), at approximately 300 feet (91.4 m), is the tallest waterfall in the island. This canyon system is much bigger than the San Cristobal and Las Bocas Canyons, and it includes other gorges and steep river valleys such as those of La Plata in Comerio and Arroyata in Cidra . This canyon is notable for being the deepest canyon in the West Indies with a maximum depth of up to 800 feet (200 m).",

A cable-mount steerable receiver and several radar transmitters for emitting signals were mounted 150 m (492 ft) above the dish . Completed in November 1963, the Arecibo Telescope was the world's largest single-aperture telescope for 53 years, until it was surpassed in July 2016 by the Five-hundred-meter Aperture Spherical Telescope (FAST) in Guizhou , China .  The Arecibo Telescope was primarily used for research in radio astronomy , atmospheric science , and radar astronomy , as well as for programs that search for extraterrestrial intelligence (SETI). Scientists wanting to use the observatory submitted proposals that were evaluated by independent scientific referees. NASA also used the telescope for near-Earth object detection programs . The observatory, funded primarily by the National Science Foundation (NSF) with partial support from NASA, was managed by Cornell University from its completion in 1963 until 2011, after which it was transferred to a partnership led by SRI International . In 2018, a consortium led by the University of Central Florida assumed operation of the facility.",

When completed in 2016, it became the tallest sculpture in North America , (as well as the tallest not only in the United States , but in the Western Hemisphere in general) surpassing Mexico's Guerrero Chimalli (which measures 200 feet or 61 meters in height including its base), and the fourth tallest worldwide, after the Statue of Unity in India (597 ft; 182 m), the Spring Temple Buddha in China (420 ft; 130 m), and the Laykyun Sekkya in Myanmar (380 ft; 120 m). After being imported to Puerto Rico, there were plans for it to be erected in Catano . After being moved to Mayaguez and facing further delays, Birth of the New World was assembled at its current location.  Originally designed by Georgian sculptor Zurab Tsereteli as a monument to commemorate the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus 's first voyage , Birth of the New World was constructed in 1991. The statue prominently depicts Columbus controlling an anachronistic depiction of a steering wheel, with a backdrop featuring the Nina , Pinta and Santa Maria traversing the Atlantic Ocean. Made of 2,750 bronze and steel pieces and weighing more than 1,300,000 pounds (650 short tons; 590 tonnes), the monument's 360 ft (110 m) height made it the tallest in the Western Hemisphere during the last decade of the 20th century, dwarfing the Statue of Liberty and the Monumento a la Virgen de la Paz .",

The cave is a popular tourist attraction for Puerto Ricans as well as tourists visiting from outside Puerto Rico. An initial admittance fee for Saturday and Sunday visits was established by the owner of a nearby gas station, due to the location's popularity. The number of visitors is at its largest on both Saturdays and Sundays from early morning to an hour before nightfall. In January 2013, a daily admission fee was established, and later raised the following month. A boardwalk project was constructed from the gas station, leading up to around 200 feet into the trail, as well as a small parking lot atop a plateau behind the gas station. After a rise in popularity and visits, different admission fees were established for certain days of the week, providing necessary safety equipment for the 45-minute guided tour.

After establishing his reputation as a portrait painter, Morse, in his middle age, contributed to the invention of a single-wire telegraph system based on European telegraphs. He was a co-developer of Morse code in 1837 and helped to develop the commercial use of telegraphy.  Samuel F. B. Morse was born in Charlestown, Boston , Massachusetts, the first child of the pastor Jedidiah Morse , who was also a geographer, and his wife Elizabeth Ann Finley Breese. His father was a great preacher of the Calvinist faith and supporter of the Federalist Party . He thought it helped preserve Puritan traditions (strict observance of Sabbath , among other things), and believed in the Federalist support of an alliance with Britain and a strong central government. Morse strongly believed in education within a Federalist framework, alongside the instillation of Calvinist virtues, morals, and prayers for his first son. His first ancestor in America was Anthony Morse, of Marlborough, Wiltshire , who had emigrated to America in 1635, and settled in Newbury, Massachusetts .",

It was formed in 1984 to preserve the last surviving sugar cane plantation line still in existence on the entire island, which was part of a large railroad system that operated around Puerto Rico prior to the 1950s.  The railroad took passengers and sightseers across Arroyo's old sugar cane fields on a fifty-minute long guided tour that explained the industry and other historic aspects of it. Most of the original railroad right-of-way is former Ponce & Guayama trackage, which was in regular use up until 1990; a short 4-mile (6.4 km) segment became the Tren del Sur in 1984. Much of the original equipment abandoned on site also served as historic props along the route.",

After gathering a record of 21\u20131\u20131 as an amateur, Escobar debuted as a professional in 1931 defeating Luis \"Kid Dominican\" Perez by knockout . Early in his career, he moved to Venezuela due to the lack of opponents in his division. There he received an opportunity for the Venezuelan Bantamweight championship, but lost by points to Enrique Chaffardet . Subsequently, he moved to New York and began boxing in other states, eventually capturing the Montreal Athletic Commission World Bantamweight Title. In 1936, he defeated Tony Marino to unify this championship with the one recognized by the International Boxing Union , in the process becoming the third Latin American undisputed world boxing champion. After retiring, he worked as a spokesperson for beer companies in New York, before returning to Puerto Rico in the 1960s, where he resided until his death. He received several posthumous recognitions and his name was used in several sports venues and buildings. In 2002, Escobar was inducted into the International Boxing Hall of Fame .",

Situated between the mountain subranges of Cordillera Central and Sierra de Cayey , San Cristobal measures 9 kilometers (5.5 mi) in length and reaches up to 750 feet (228.6 m) in depth, making it the deepest land canyon in Puerto Rico and the West Indies in the Caribbean . Home to some of the tallest waterfalls and hundreds of species of flora and fauna in the island, the canyon is government-protected as a natural area since 1978, which came after the site was used as a land fill from 1954 to 1974. San Cristobal and its northerly neighbor of Las Bocas Canyon are part of a larger canyon system belonging to the La Plata River basin in the central mountainous region of Puerto Rico.  The San Cristobal Canyon is mainly carved by the flow of the Usabon River , an eastward tributary of the La Plata River ( Rio de la Plata ), which at approximately 46 miles (74 km) is the longest river in Puerto Rico. The river flow of the Usabon is fed by numerous tributaries, particularly the Aibonito and Barranquitas Rivers, which flow from the south and north of the canyon, respectively. These rivers are named after the municipalities they originate from, to which the Usabon functions as a natural municipal boundary. This river system, along with its wider hydrological basin of La Plata, have sculpted the canyonlands of the eastern Cordillera Central of Puerto Rico. This process has created numerous waterfalls, some of which are the tallest in Puerto Rico. For example, La Vaca Falls ( Salto La Vaca ), at approximately 300 feet (91.4 m), is the tallest waterfall in the island. This canyon system is much bigger than the San Cristobal and Las Bocas Canyons, and it includes other gorges and steep river valleys such as those of La Plata in Comerio and Arroyata in Cidra . This canyon is notable for being the deepest canyon in the West Indies with a maximum depth of up to 800 feet (200 m).",

Before its establishment in 1993, the area was a military installation during the Second World War , and many of the bunkers and ammunition warehouses are still preserved within the area. The park today contains several hiking trails, paths for mountain biking , playgrounds for children, gazebos for picnics, and areas for horse-riding. Climbing is also allowed in some of the limestone cliffs, locally known as mogotes .  The park is managed by the Compania de Parques Nacionales de Puerto Rico , which serves as the department of parks and recreation of the territory, although everyday management is done by the Centro Ambiental Santa Ana , established by Frank H.

Living alone or in herds, it feeds on underwater plants and uses its whiskers to navigate. It is divided into two subspecies, the Florida manatee ( T. m. latirostris ) in the United States and the Antillean manatee ( T. m. manatus ) in the Caribbean, both of which are endangered and face pressure from habitat loss, pollution, and other human activity. The West Indian manatee is the largest living member of the sirenians (order Sirenia), a group of large aquatic mammals that includes the dugong , other manatees , and the extinct Steller's sea cow .  Manatees are herbivores , have developed vocal communication abilities, and are covered in highly sensitive whiskers (called vibrissae ) that are used for feeding and navigation. In breeding season, several males form mating herds around an individual female; on average, one calf is born to a female manatee every two to three years.",

It is located between the municipalities of Camuy , Hatillo , and Lares in northwestern Puerto Rico , but the main entrance to the park is located in Quebrada, Camuy. The caverns are part of a large network of natural limestone caves and underground waterways carved out by the third-largest underground river in the world, the Rio Camuy ( Camuy River ). The cave system was \"discovered\" in 1958 and was first documented in the 1973 book Discovery at the Rio Camuy ( ISBN 0-517-50594-0 ) by Russell and Jeanne Gurnee, but there is archaeological evidence that these caves were explored hundreds of years ago by the Taino Indians, Puerto Rico's first inhabitants. Over 10 miles of caverns, 220 caves and 17 entrances to the Camuy cave system have been mapped so far. This, however, is only a fraction of the entire system which many experts believe still holds another 800 caves. Only a small part of the complex is open to the public. The 268-acre park built around the cave system features tours of some of the caves and sinkholes, and is one of the most popular natural attractions in Puerto Rico. After restorations necessitated by Hurricane Maria , a destructive storm that struck Puerto Rico in 2017, the park re-opened on March 24, 2021. It then closed again from September 2022 until February 2023 due to Hurricane Fiona .  \"Cueva Clara de Empalme\" or Clara Cave is the main attraction at the Rio Camuy Cave Park. A single chamber of this cave system has been developed for the public, starting in 1986. Regular cavern guided tour and audio tours are available at the site. Since November 2010, night tours called ECO NIGHTS have been organized weekly under special reservations. The tours start with the screening a short movie in a 90-seat theater, explaining the Rio Camuy Cave System and site safety rules, followed by a train ride that takes visitors into the entrance of Clara Cave. The huge chamber is 700 ft (212m) in length and 215 ft (65m) high. Once inside this chamber, visitors are able to see an entrance from the roof of \"Sumidero de Empalme\" that is 60m from the surface, as well as stalactites, stalagmites, unique formations and thousands of bats.",

He and his wife raised their two children here, although the house was abandoned in 1952 following his sudden death. The house remained abandoned for a long period and was left to ruin due to vandalism in the 1980s and damages during Hurricane Georges in 1998, until it was acquired by the Institute of Puerto Rican Culture ( Instituto de Cultura Puertorriquena ) and some members of the Pinero family who sponsored its renovation and preservation. The house today is a museum dedicated to the life of Jesus T. Pinero and to the everyday life of the time between the 1930s and 1950s. The house was reopened to visitors in 2021 and guided tours are available.",

Theologically , it is chiefly defined by regarding the Torah , both Written and Oral , as literally revealed by God on Mount Sinai and faithfully transmitted ever since.  Orthodox Judaism therefore advocates a strict observance of Jewish Law, or halakha , which is to be interpreted and determined only according to traditional methods and in adherence to the continuum of received precedent through the ages. It regards the entire halakhic system as ultimately grounded in immutable revelation, essentially beyond external and historical influence. More than any theoretical issue, obeying the dietary , purity , ethical and other laws of halakha is the hallmark of Orthodoxy. Practicing members are easily distinguishable by their lifestyle, refraining from doing numerous routine actions on the Sabbath and holidays, consuming only kosher food, praying thrice a day, studying the Torah often, donning head covering and tassels for men and modest clothing for women, and so forth. Other key doctrines include belief in a future bodily resurrection of the dead , divine reward and punishment for the righteous and the sinners, the Election of Israel as a people bound by a covenant with God , and an eventual Messianic Age ruled by a salvific Messiah -King who will restore the Temple in Jerusalem and gather the people to Zion .",

This forest area was established by a proclamation in 1935 and was formerly listed as a state forest on July 1, 1975, through the Law of Puerto Rican Forests (Law Num. 133). The area was preserved with the intention of developing it for its timber industry . The state forest was established with the goal of protecting the hydrological basins of the Loiza , Patillas and La Plata rivers which were being affected by erosion caused by deforestation throughout the 20th century. In more recent times the forest has become an important wildlife preserve, ecological research site and recreational area.",

Then, in 1970, the Federal Government exchanged with the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico the Toro Negro section of the Caribbean National Forest for some forested lands belonging to the Commonwealth and located adjacent to the much larger federal lands at Luquillo National Forest resulting in the creation at Luquillo of the current El Yunque National Forest .

The Banos became a popular tourist attraction among the early Spanish settlers which prompted the construction of a resort by local entrepreneurs. Coamo was the site of an important battle during the Puerto Rico Campaign of the Spanish\u2013American War and were subject to artillery bombardments which damaged the resort. The historic Banos and resort were restored during the 20th century by the Government of Puerto Rico, becoming once more a popular tourist attraction.",

General stores often sell staple food items such as milk and bread, and various household goods such as hardware and electrical supplies. The concept of the general store is very old, and although some still exist, there are far fewer than there once were, due to urbanization , urban sprawl , and the relatively recent phenomenon of big-box stores .

It is known for its shallow turquoise waters, white sand, swimming areas, and diving sites. It stretches for a mile around a sheltered, horseshoe-shaped bay. Playa Flamenco is a popular beach destination for both Culebra and Puerto Rico. In March 2014, Flamenco Beach was ranked 3rd best beach in the world with a TripAdvisor Travelers' Choice Award . In August 2016, it was announced that Flamenco Beach had regained its Blue Flag Beach international distinction.  Flamenco is located on the northern shore of Culebra. Its name in Spanish ( flamingo beach ) comes from the numerous Caribbean flamingos ( Phoenicopterus ruber ) that were once common in Flamenco Lagoon . The beach lies on a half-mile-wide, horseshoe strip of coast. The beach is bordered by the Culebra National Wildlife Refuge , which is of itself one of the oldest wildlife preserves in the United States. Off the coast of Flamenco, approximately a quarter mile, is a reef where the surf breaks. Characteristic of Flamenco is the beach's white sand and shallow clear waters.",

The state forest is named after the nearby Central Aguirre , a historic sugarcane plantation and refinery, and the barrio of Salinas of the same name . The forest is notable for its dense mangrove forests and salt ponds . As such it is an ecologically diverse area that is home to 13 species of reptiles, 4 species of amphibians and 3 species of bats. At least 184 bird species can be found within the forest and the area is an important bird nesting site. Some notable bird species found here are yellow-crowned night herons ( Nyctanassa violacea ), mangrove rails ( Rallus longirostris ), yellow warblers ( Setophaga petechia ), and endangered birds such as yellow-shouldered blackbirds ( Agelaius xanthomus) .

This forest area was established by a proclamation in 1935 and was formerly listed as a state forest on July 1, 1975, through the Law of Puerto Rican Forests (Law Num. 133). The area was preserved with the intention of developing it for its timber industry . The state forest was established with the goal of protecting the hydrological basins of the Loiza , Patillas and La Plata rivers which were being affected by erosion caused by deforestation throughout the 20th century. In more recent times the forest has become an important wildlife preserve, ecological research site and recreational area.",

(no relation to the automobile manufacturer), an American investment firm that developed a sugar cane manufacturing and export business, and its accompanying employee town facilities.  It included 317 contributing buildings , 17 contributing structures , and seven contributing sites on 326 acres (1.32 km 2 ). The sugar mill town and its facilities were constructed into separate living areas for white Americans, the American Zone, and those for Puerto Rican employees, The Puerto Rican Zone. On December 26, 1934, a series of protracted labor strikes began against the structured racial segregation and subsistent wages of the sugar cane industry, locally, and across Puerto Rico. The international price of sugar declined over the course of the 20th century, and by the 1960s, the company abandoned the town. At the time, its operation was taken over by local and national government, but with the continued decline of the international sugar price, the factory and its facilities were permanently closed in 1993.",

The main geographical feature of the forest reserve is Monte Guilarte , which is Puerto Rico's 7th highest mountain at 3,950 feet (1,204 m) above sea level. While Monte Guilarte is located in the municipality of Adjuntas , the forest's borders also include parts of Guayanilla , Penuelas and Yauco .  In 1935, the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (Spanish: Administracion de Reconstruccion de Puerto Rico ) acquired 3,500 acres in and around Monte Guilarte in the municipality of Adjuntas with the goal of preserving the area as a forest reserve. The reserve was intended to be a wildlife preserve for the conservation of numerous plant and animal species found in the area but also for recreational purposes. Today the forest is managed by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA), which has enlarged the protected area of the forest which now extends 4,822 acres.",

The area also contains a number of remnants that showcase the military history of the region: a former US Army lookout post on top of El Morrillo , and a number of bunkers built during the Second World War . The forests and wetlands were acquired by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources in 1984, and it was proclaimed the Humacao Wildlife Refuge in 1986.

Located in the estuary of Humacao, Punta Santiago is famous for its fishing heritage, its iconic pier and Cayo Santiago , popularly known as Monkey Island ( Spanish : Isla de de los Monos ) after its Rhesus macaque population. The barrio is also the home of the Humacao Nature Reserve and the Punta Santiago Beach and Vacation Area. Punta Santiago is one of the most vulnerable barrios to flooding and complete destruction whenever hurricanes enter Puerto Rico through the area of Humacao.  The fishing village of Punta Santiago was originally called Playa de Humacao as it was the closest beach to Humacao Pueblo , the historic and administrative downtown area of Humacao. The community of Punta Santiago used to be part of two former barrios of Humacao, one called Humacao Playa and the other called Mabu. By the end of the 19th century barrio Mabu had been eliminated and incorporated into barrio Playa, now renamed Punta Santiago after the geographical headland or point ( punta ) where the fishing village is located.",

Toro Negro's mountains have heights reaching up to 4,400 feet (1,300 m) and include Cerro de Punta , Cerro Jayuya and Cerro Rosa , the three highest peaks in the island. Nested among these mountains is Lake Guineo, the island's highest lake. The forest has 18 kilometers (11 mi) of trails, an observation tower, two natural swimming pools ( Spanish :\" charcos \"), camping and picnic areas, nine rivers, and numerous creeks and waterfalls. The forest spans areas within the municipalities of Ponce , Jayuya , Orocovis , Ciales , and Juana Diaz , and consists of seven non-contiguous tracts of land. The largest contiguous segment of the forest is located in the municipalities of Ponce and Jayuya. Some 40% of the area of Toro Negro State Forest is located in Ponce's Barrio Anon .  When created in 1935 as part of the Caribbean National Forest , the Toro Negro Forest Reserve was managed by the United States government , first via the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration of the Department of the Interior (1935\u20131942) and later through the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture (1942\u20131970). Then, in 1970, the Federal Government exchanged with the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico the Toro Negro section of the Caribbean National Forest for some forested lands belonging to the Commonwealth and located adjacent to the much larger federal lands at Luquillo National Forest resulting in the creation at Luquillo of the current El Yunque National Forest . In 1970, the Government of Puerto Rico's Departmento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales (DRNA) opened the Toro Negro Forest Reserve as a Commonwealth state forest and renamed it Bosque Estatal de Toro Negro (Toro Negro State Forest).",

Boqueron State Forest is one of the oldest forests in the Puerto Rico state forest system. It was proclaimed and designated a forest preserve in 1918 by Puerto Rico governor Arthur Yager with the purpose of preserving the mangrove biomes in Cabo Rojo and Lajas. Two additional segments, the Guayacan and Cuevas Keys, were added in 1943. The areas of the Molino mangroves, Los Morrillos (famous for its lighthouse ) and the Guaniquilla Lagoon and surrounding mangroves were annexed to the Boqueron State Forest in 1980.",

The surrounding shelf of the island is mostly coral reef . There are buildings on the western end of the island associated with the Department of Marine Sciences, University of Puerto Rico at Mayaguez . UPR- Mayaguez is an important center in the Atlantic region for the study of tropical marine science due to its location, facilities, and first-rate researchers. The research facilities includes the Puerto Rico Water Resources and Environmental Research Institute, the Caribbean Coral Reef Institute (CCRI), the Research and Development Center, the Agricultural Research Station and the Caribbean Atmospheric Research Center (ATMOSCarib).  A free-ranging colony of feral Cuban iguanas , released from a zoo that was closed on the island in the 1950s inhabit all parts of the island. While the iguanas are endangered in their native Cuba and are currently protected by the US Endangered Species Act , there has been talk of eliminating or reducing the population here as they are considered an invasive species . Currently dogs, cats, and most tourists are barred from the island to protect the iguanas. This has turned the island into somewhat of an unofficial bird sanctuary and brown pelicans , cattle egrets , and herons are commonly observed here.",

The design was drawn and laid out by Joaquin Gisbert in 1890. The lighthouse construction was initially overseen by Adrian Duffaut. It was built from March 13, 1891, to September 29, 1893. Final construction was taken over by the Spanish Body of Engineers according to annotations of the historian Carlos Moral. It was originally named Faro de Mala Pascua after the cape to the west. Later, it was moved and renamed after the Point of the construction site so the light could perform a double duty warning ships off the Sargent reef. On August 8, 1899, the lighthouse suffered damage from Hurricane San Ciriaco; the town suffered heavy damage.",

The idea for the asylum for the poor began with a campaign to build it by Salvador Suau y Mulet when he was Mayor of Mayaguez . This building is highly representative of the 19th century institutional architecture of Puerto Rico. The building was designed and built by commissioned state architects Manuel V. Domenech and Luis Perocier in 1895. The building as it stands today however was not fully completed until 1920 due to complications caused by the 1918 earthquake, after which it was restored and expanded. The institution was operated by the Sisters of Charity during its first years.",

It is located at Candelaria Street, (formerly Calle McKinley ) and Dr. Basora Streets, in the city of Mayaguez . The theater building consists of the Lucy Boscana Hall and the Roberto Cole Cafe Theater .  It was originally erected by Francisco Maymon Palmer in 1909. Maymon's parents emigrated to Puerto Rico from Italy in the 19th century. They settled in the town of San German. Early in the 20th century Francisco tried to build a theatre in the town of San German but was unable due to the existing religious culture then, which considered a theatre as a \"bad influence' on the local population. Maymon was an entrepreneur by vocation, having travelled to Europe and the United States in his 20s, and he would not be stopped. He moved to the nearby city of Mayaguez where he established himself as one of the pioneers of the industry of cinematography in the island of Puerto Rico, introducing this new form of Visual Art early in the beginning of the 20th century by showing silent films throughout the nearby towns and becoming the exclusive distributor for 'Nicholas Power Co.' movie projectors throughout the Caribbean islands. The 'Nicholas Power Company' was located in New York. With the help of his business partners Mr. Jose Rahola and Mr. Fundador Vargas, he imported movies from the Pathe Company in Europe , showing them in town centers (plazas) under the stars and at the old Mayaguez Municipal Theater ('Teatro Municipal'). The latter no longer exists, as it was destroyed in the 1918 earthquake that hit the city and was never rebuilt, hence the Teatro Yaguez became the city's preferred gathering place for opera, plays, concerts, and silent movies.",

The caves are located in Barahona barrio in Morovis and have been studied in depth by Roberto Martinez and Ovidio Davila. Martinez pushed for designating the cave system as a national park system. There are 60 caves in the Cabachuelas zone which was declared a natural reserve on February 29, 2012, with the signing of law 129 by then governor, Luis Fortuno . Since then a process of identifying the land around the cave system-what needed to be purchased from private owners began, and it was decided that there were 16 privately owned properties which should become part of the reserve. In February 2019 the park opened to the public. Guided tours for groups of up to 15 people are coordinated by CABACOOP, Proyecto Cabachuelas.",

In 1917, his family moved to the Old San Juan section of San Juan, the capital of Puerto Rico. There he received his primary and secondary education. As a young man he learned to play various musical instruments, among them the piano, the guitar and the mandolin, under the tutelage of Amelia Maestu y Jorge Rubiano. His father, a lawyer, sent him to Ontario, Canada to study law, however while he was in Canada, he learned to play baseball and received an offer to try out for the New York Giants major league team. He did not accept the offer and when he returned to Puerto Rico he joined the \"Senadores de San Juan\" (San Juan Senators) baseball club. Rivero married and found it difficult to sustain his family economically as a professional baseball player, therefore he moved with his family to the town of Cayey and worked as a physical education instructor at a local school.",

' Chest of the Dead ' ; also in English: Deadman's Chest or Coffin Island ) is an uninhabited island off the southern coast of Puerto Rico , in the municipality of Ponce . The island and its surrounding waters are protected by the Caja de Muertos Nature Reserve , because of its native turtle traffic and ecological value of its dry forests and reefs. Hikers and beachgoers are often seen in the island, which can be reached by ferry from the La Guancha Boardwalk sector of Ponce Playa . Together with Cardona , Ratones , Morrillito , Isla del Frio , Gatas , and Isla de Jueyes , Caja de Muertos is one of seven islands ascribed to the municipality of Ponce .  It is believed the island is only some 4,000 years old, and stone art left on the island attests it has been visited by man over milennnia. Taino natives made frequent trips to the island on fishing expeditions, and when they were defeated by the Spanish during the 1511 battle of Spanish\u2013Taino War for Boriken , the natives attempted a retreat to the Caja de Muertos but shortly afterwards they were either captured or killed. During much of the 17th century, the island is known to have been used as a hideout by pirates and mutineers. For example, in 1599-1600 it was used by a group merchants-turned-pirates who, after learning of a Portuguese ship filled with gold, silver, precious stones, other treasures, attacked it and appropriated its contents. As they attempted to travel back to England, though, they faced an attempted mutiny and, surviving it, they took refuge at Caja de Muertos. Venturing to the Puerto Rico mainland for provisions, they were killed, except for one, who later confessed to the existence of the hidden treasure. The Spanish colonial governor then appropriated the remaining treasure for construction projects among other uses.",

By late 2020 arrangements were made for the merchants that operated from waterfront kiosks to reopen their businesses out of provisional facilities at a temporary location away from the waterfront while reconstruction of the waterfront area takes place.  Originally La Guancha consisted of a road and sidewalk alongside a dike built close to the easternmost shore of barrio Playa across from Ponce Yacht Club . The romantic area was frequented by families and sweethearts alike, especially on weekends, for relaxation and bonding . During the administration of Mayor Cordero , however, a number of facilities were added to the La Guancha area at a cost of over $18 million, developing it into a new recreational complex.

It is called the Museo del Autonomismo Puertorriqueno .

They built their first church of wood and metal at this site in 1873, aided by materials sent by Queen Victoria 's government, including a bell cast in England in 1870. Located at the intersection of Marina, Mayor, and Abolicion streets, it was the first Anglican church built on the island. Holy Trinity was still the only Protestant church in Puerto Rico at the time of the United States invasion in 1898.  Because the old church had deteriorated, it was taken down; and a new church building was constructed on the same site in 1926 under supervision from the Rev. Philip Locke . It has a synthesis of English neo-Gothic and Spanish-colonial styles. The 1870 bell was installed in the new church. The architect or designer is unknown. The church was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 29 September 1986.",

Now (2019) known as Primera Iglesia Metodista La Resurreccion , this church was built in 1907 on land that was previously owned by the Vendrell Toro family, a prominent family in Ponce. In 1962 the church served as the first site of the Interamerican University of Puerto Rico at Ponce , until more spacious quarters were established at the intersection of Calle Estrella and Calle Castillo.

Toro Negro's mountains have heights reaching up to 4,400 feet (1,300 m) and include Cerro de Punta , Cerro Jayuya and Cerro Rosa , the three highest peaks in the island. Nested among these mountains is Lake Guineo, the island's highest lake. The forest has 18 kilometers (11 mi) of trails, an observation tower, two natural swimming pools ( Spanish :\" charcos \"), camping and picnic areas, nine rivers, and numerous creeks and waterfalls. The forest spans areas within the municipalities of Ponce , Jayuya , Orocovis , Ciales , and Juana Diaz , and consists of seven non-contiguous tracts of land. The largest contiguous segment of the forest is located in the municipalities of Ponce and Jayuya. Some 40% of the area of Toro Negro State Forest is located in Ponce's Barrio Anon .  When created in 1935 as part of the Caribbean National Forest , the Toro Negro Forest Reserve was managed by the United States government , first via the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration of the Department of the Interior (1935\u20131942) and later through the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture (1942\u20131970). Then, in 1970, the Federal Government exchanged with the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico the Toro Negro section of the Caribbean National Forest for some forested lands belonging to the Commonwealth and located adjacent to the much larger federal lands at Luquillo National Forest resulting in the creation at Luquillo of the current El Yunque National Forest . In 1970, the Government of Puerto Rico's Departmento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales (DRNA) opened the Toro Negro Forest Reserve as a Commonwealth state forest and renamed it Bosque Estatal de Toro Negro (Toro Negro State Forest).",

The building dates from 1913. It was designed by the architect Blas Silva . The architecture consists of 19th Classical revival and Art Nouveau architectural styles. The building is of architectural significance for its aggressive incorporation of curvilinear forms and ornaments . The complete preservation of the original architecture of the Monsanto Residence, its unique design amongst the houses of Ponce, and its location within the historic urban core of the city qualify it as one of a series of grand houses and an integral part of the character of Ponce.  The Monsanto Residence at Calle Castillo No.34 is an architectural landmark in the city of Ponce. Designed by the well-known architect Blas Silva in 1913, the residence stands out among the great houses of Ponce for its aggressive incorporation of curvilinear forms and ornament. Adapting the curves of the \" Art Nouveau \" to the persistent Neo-classicism of Puerto Rico and the recently born Creole vocabulary of Ponce, Silva succeeded in creating a movement in architecture which broke away from the traditional forms while remaining within them. The traditional continuous raised verandah along the front facade is broken up into two and twisted out of its usual linearity into the curved forms preserved today. Characteristic of the architecture to abound in Ponce contemporaneous to Castillo 34 is a profusion of applique, and eclectic combination and juxtaposition of shapes, particularly curvilinear, and a general ostentation of articulation. Blas Silva was probably the most established of the \"wedding-cake architects\" and was thus sought after mostly by the \"nouveau riche\" of the period. Silva's houses are among the richest in Ponce, among which the Monsanto Residence stands put for its circular porches. Other buildings by Blas Silva include the Frau Residence and the Salazar-Candal Residence , both also listed in the NRHP .",

The historic building is located at 47 Salud Street, in the city's historic district , at the northwest corner of Salud and Aurora streets. The house is also known as Casa del Abogado (House of the Attorney). In April 2019, the house was turned into Casa Mujer by MedCentro, a women's health business concern.  The Oppenheimer House is one of Ponce's most distinctive residential structures. It was designed in 1913 for Dona Isabel Oppenheimer-de Santiago by one of Puerto Rico's foremost early 20th century architects, Alfredo Weichers. Two years earlier, in 1911, he had built Casa Serralles , which today is home to the Museum of Puerto Rican Music . Mr. Weichers left Puerto Rico to study architecture in Barcelona, Spain , and returned to Ponce where he built various structures in the Spanish-Art Nouveau style. Weichers designed many of the mansions of Ponce's aristocratic society of his time. The Oppenheimer residence is one such structure. Architecturally, the house is the result of an artful combination of elements from the contemporary modernist movement and the simpler townspeople's building traditions used in the hot southern coast of Puerto Rico.",

' Chest of the Dead ' ; also in English: Deadman's Chest or Coffin Island ) is an uninhabited island off the southern coast of Puerto Rico , in the municipality of Ponce . The island and its surrounding waters are protected by the Caja de Muertos Nature Reserve , because of its native turtle traffic and ecological value of its dry forests and reefs. Hikers and beachgoers are often seen in the island, which can be reached by ferry from the La Guancha Boardwalk sector of Ponce Playa . Together with Cardona , Ratones , Morrillito , Isla del Frio , Gatas , and Isla de Jueyes , Caja de Muertos is one of seven islands ascribed to the municipality of Ponce .  It is believed the island is only some 4,000 years old, and stone art left on the island attests it has been visited by man over milennnia. Taino natives made frequent trips to the island on fishing expeditions, and when they were defeated by the Spanish during the 1511 battle of Spanish\u2013Taino War for Boriken , the natives attempted a retreat to the Caja de Muertos but shortly afterwards they were either captured or killed. During much of the 17th century, the island is known to have been used as a hideout by pirates and mutineers. For example, in 1599-1600 it was used by a group merchants-turned-pirates who, after learning of a Portuguese ship filled with gold, silver, precious stones, other treasures, attacked it and appropriated its contents. As they attempted to travel back to England, though, they faced an attempted mutiny and, surviving it, they took refuge at Caja de Muertos. Venturing to the Puerto Rico mainland for provisions, they were killed, except for one, who later confessed to the existence of the hidden treasure. The Spanish colonial governor then appropriated the remaining treasure for construction projects among other uses.",

The building is a large four-story structure built in the 1930s for the owner of Ponce's Destileria Serralles , one of Puerto Rico's largest rum distilleries. The distillery was once also home to Puerto Rico's largest sugar-factory called Central Mercedita , producers of the Snow White sugar brand. The building, known as Castillo Serralles , was designed by Pedro Adolfo de Castro in 1930 in the Spanish Colonial Revival style.  The museum sits on a 2.5-acre lot and opened on 20 February 1991. Visitors can tour the refurbished home, which has been furnished to appear as it did in the 1930s. There is also a temporary exhibit area for local artists. The Serralles Castle is now part of a large complex that includes the Cruceta El Vigia , a Japanese Garden , and a butterfly garden ( Mariposario ).

        "content": "The Ponce High School is public educational institution in Ponce, Puerto Rico , offering grades nine through twelve. The school's main building is a historic structure located on Cristina Street, in the Ponce Historic Zone . From its beginning the school has secured a unique place in Puerto Rico's educational history. Of over 3,000 schools erected in Puerto Rico in the first quarter of the twentieth century, Ponce High was the largest, \"at a time enrolling more students than all the other Puerto Rico high schools combined\", and for many years enrolling more students than any other high school in Puerto Rico. The cost of the building in 1915 dollars was $150,000 USD ($4.52 million in 2023 dollars ). The building was listed on the U.S. National Register of Historic Places on 4 August 1987. The school has the only diamond-level DECA chapter in Puerto Rico. The Ponce High School building is \"among the most important public buildings ever built in Puerto Rico.\" The school is the oldest continuously-operating high school in Puerto Rico.  The history of the institution dates back to January 1899. On 25 January 1899 a historic fire took place on the lot currently occupied by the High School. The fire is known as the \"Fuego del Polvorin\" (the Fire of the Ammunition Depot). At that time the lot was used as a U.S. Army ammunition depot. Today a register marks the location of the fire. In November 1899, the new American government authorized the establishment of a public secondary school in Ponce modeled after the American school system. In 1903 the Roosevelt Industrial School was built on land where the US military had its munitions depot that caused the fire. Five years after El Polvorin , in the 1904-1905 timeframe, a two-story building with 12 classrooms was built to accommodate the Ruiz Gandia Grammar School in the same spacious El Polvorin lot. The first class of Ponce High School students formed in 1902. As new facilities were completed, the students were moved to them. For the 1907-1908 school year another building was built called the McKinley building, and the Ponce High students occupied said facilities as well. Construction of the now-historic Ponce High School building on Cristina Street started in 1915 and the building was inaugurated in 1920.",

The Plaza and the alley are one and the same.  Ponce's Plaza de los Perros (English: Plaza of the Dogs), receives its name from the packs of stray dogs that gathered there to feed on the discarded meat scraps. A product of the rapid urban growth experienced in the city during the early 20th century, the Plaza was built in 1926 to relieve the overcrowded farmer's market (\"Plaza del Mercado\") and provide an adequate market place for perishable meat products.",

Originally built as a social club for Ponce's elite, it is currently used as the premier reception center of \"The Noble City of Puerto Rico\" . The building, designed by Agustin Camilo Gonzalez in the Second Empire and Neo-Rococo styles, has a French facade and tones. It was listed in the National Register of Historic Places on 28 October 1987. It is located at the corner of Marina and Luna streets. The building has been called \"an icon of Ponce's architecture, history, and identity.\" It is owned and administered by the Ponce Municipal Government. In 1936, during the Great Depression , the Casino declared bankruptcy and shut down. It subsequently had various uses: a postal office, a public health unit, tax collector's office, and even a temporary city hall. In 1990 it was restored by the Ponce Municipal Government, and has since been used for high-ranking official municipal business. For example, it was here where the dinner to honor Prince of Asturias, His Majesty Felipe de Borbon , took place.  Ponce had three casinos before this one. The first Casino de Ponce was founded in 1862, on Calle Marina. It met at the location that was later (in 1911) used by Rosendo Matienzo Cintron as his law office. The organization stopped meeting due to political quarrels between the two political factions in its membership representing groups for and against the government of Spanish General Sanz, but it reformed on 19 July 1876. This second Casino de Ponce was located on the second floor of the property owned by Don Carlos Cabrera Martinez, one of the distinguished members of the Ponce high society. Their meeting location was on an elegant structure at the northeast corner of Calle Marina and Calle Cristina, facing Plaza Las Delicias . The third Casino de Ponce reformed on 29 June 1897. It met next to Teatro La Perla , on the east side of Calle Mayor, between Calle Isabel and Calle Cristina, immediately north of the theater. It moved 25 years later, in 1922, to the pompous locale at the southeast corner of Calle Marina and Calle Luna, that is the subject of this article.",

Completed in 1897, the year before the Spanish\u2013American War of 1898, this building was the last major construction undergone by the Spanish Government in the Americas. From 1905 to the mid 1970s the structure served as the Asilo de Ciegos de Ponce (Ponce Blind Asylum). As of 2020 the building sits abandoned.  The structure commonly known as the Asilo de Ciegos (Home of the Blind) was built between 1896 and 1897 to serve as hospital for the city of Ponce's military garrison. The Royal Spanish Engineering Corps constructed this building in the then popular neoclassic style which was common to the old San Juan area, but was not at the time prevalent in Ponce.

It is visited annually by thousands of locals and tourists alike and is considered one of the city\u2019s main places of interest.  Since the beginning of the 20th century, Calle Atocha was the main commercial artery in Ponce. It was the first street in the city to be built with the necessary incline as to allow rainwater to run freely away from buildings and walkways. Despite modifications undergone by many of the building owners along this stretch of Atocha Street throughout the years, a number of buildings continue to preserve the original design characteristics of Ponce\u2019s traditional architecture , while others take on the traditional character of bygone years. In 1991, as part of the Ponce en Marcha (Ponce On the Move) plan, the government of the Municipality of Ponce closed the street to vehicular traffic and converted into a pedestrian promenade.",

It was built under the mayoral administration of Rafael Cordero Santiago , Mayor of Ponce from 1989 to 2004, at a cost of 2.6 million dollars, and inaugurated on 23 June 1998. It receives over 750,000 visitors a year. In September 2017 the boardwalk was damaged by Hurricane Maria and the area closest to the water was fenced off and off-limits to the public, but the rest of the facilities continued to operate uninterrupted. In January 2020, however, while still fenced off from the 2017 hurricane damage, the boardwalk\u2014together with its adjoining recreational complex\u2014closed when the area suffered severe damage from the 2020 Puerto Rico earthquakes and, as of 17 June 2020, it remained closed. By late 2020 arrangements were made for the merchants that operated from waterfront kiosks to reopen their businesses out of provisional facilities at a temporary location away from the waterfront while reconstruction of the waterfront area takes place.  The Paseo Tablado La Guancha is located in Ponce's sea shore. Built in the 1990s, the boardwalk overlooks the Club Nautico de Ponce and has many restaurants and bars. It also has kiosks which sell food and alcoholic beverages. \"It's basically a boardwalk filled with many different local eateries. They mostly sell delicious 'fritters', like what we call 'bacalaitos', or fried cod fish . There are also 'empanadillas', which are basically fried meat- or cheese-filled turnovers. Apart from the food, the boardwalk is a great place to relax and take a light stroll. At one end of the boardwalk there is a lookout tower, giving an elevated view of La Guancha. You can see many big tarpons . These are not the prettiest, and do something really weird with their mouths once in a while. Just outside the boardwalk there are fun playgrounds for kids and a cool arcade. Ponce's beach is very near the boardwalk, you can even walk to it.\" There is also a marina where visitors can rent pedal boats and kayaks to explore the bay, an open-space stage for social and other similar activities, and an observation tower from where the Cardona Island Lighthouse can be seen. A 45-minute boat ride is also available to Caja de Muertos , a small island that features the 1887 Caja de Muertos Lighthouse and several beaches .",

Rooms currently used as offices were jail cells before, and the courtyard of the City Hall was the place where executions took place. The last public hanging on the island happened in its courtyard.

Hurricanes in September 1928 and again in 1931, prevented the Ponce work to move forward once more, as money that had been obtained for the International YMCA Committee had to be used by the San Juan YMCA to help towards repairs to the San Juan YMCA building after these storms. In 1934, however, the YMCA of Puerto Rico became self-supporting.",

It was built in 1922 by the American Railroad Company to replace a 1907 steel bridge as part of the construction of the national railway system that connected the island during the first half of the twentieth century. It was built on a concrete platform that held the existing steel bridge without interrupting the passage of the railway. The new bridge could hold two locomotives of 84 tons each. It was designed by Etienne Totti from Yauco who was the head engineer for the company. The bridge was restored by the municipality of Quebradillas, unfortunately as part of the repair the base was widened altering the character of the structure and hindering the view of the bridge.

        "content": "Whale watching is the practice of observing whales and dolphins ( cetaceans ) in their natural habitat. Whale watching is mostly a recreational activity (cf. birdwatching ), but it can also serve scientific and/or educational purposes. A study prepared for International Fund for Animal Welfare in 2009 estimated that 13 million people went whale watching globally in 2008. Whale watching generates $2.1 billion per annum in tourism revenue worldwide, employing around 13,000 workers. The size and rapid growth of the industry has led to complex and continuing debates with the whaling industry about the best use of whales as a natural resource .  Organized whale watching started in the United States, when Cabrillo National Monument in San Diego was declared a public venue for observing the migration of gray whales ; the spectacle attracted 10,000 visitors in its first year, 1950. In 1955 the first water-based whale watching commenced in the same area, charging customers $1 per trip to view the whales at closer quarters. The industry spread throughout the western coast of the United States over the following decade.",

It included 317 contributing buildings , 17 contributing structures , and seven contributing sites on 326 acres (1.32 km 2 ). The sugar mill town and its facilities were constructed into separate living areas for white Americans, the American Zone, and those for Puerto Rican employees, The Puerto Rican Zone. On December 26, 1934, a series of protracted labor strikes began against the structured racial segregation and subsistent wages of the sugar cane industry, locally, and across Puerto Rico. The international price of sugar declined over the course of the 20th century, and by the 1960s, the company abandoned the town. At the time, its operation was taken over by local and national government, but with the continued decline of the international sugar price, the factory and its facilities were permanently closed in 1993.",

According to Rafael Rodriguez, Chaplain and director of pastoral services at the Universidad del Sagrado Corazon located in the Santurce district of the capital, the location of the cemetery is central to the Puerto Rican belief in the separation of death and life. The colonial Spanish government at the time construction of the cemetery commenced, viewed death with fear because it was a mystery. Therefore, they decided to build the cemetery to overlook the Atlantic Ocean to symbolize the spirit's journey to cross over to the afterlife.",

The cornerstone for the congregation's first church was laid on December 26, 1902. Old San Juan increasingly became a commercial center and its residents moved elsewhere. In 1928 Bishop Charles Colmore proposed relocating St. John's and St. Luke's Church in new locations. The following year the bishop spoke of St. John's and St. Catherine's Training School for Women relocating at Santurce with the hope that St. John's Day School and the rectory would join them. The groundbreaking for the present church took place on February 22, 1929, and it was completed the following February.",

Prior to the establishment of the Capitol, the Legislative Assembly used the Provincial Delegation Building, which now houses the Department of State . The idea of constructing a capitol was first introduced by former Resident Commissioner Luis Munoz Rivera in 1907, and was partly meant to demonstrate some degree of civilian rule in the island, which at the time was already a colony of the United States .

The custom house is located at the site of the former main port of the city of San Juan, north of the former Spanish Arsenal of San Juan , and next to the Las Darsenas and Immigrants' Square ( Plaza del Inmigrante ) and the Jose V. Toledo Federal Building and United States Courthouse . The large two-storey custom house is considered by the NRHP to be a superb example of Spanish Colonial Revival architecture in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean. It is most notable for its size, its elaborate terracotta-ornamented central tower and its pink-colored exterior.  The custom house was designed by architect and Office of the Supervising Architect of the Treasury inspector Albert B. Nichols , who also designed the custom houses of Fajardo and Ponce . It was built between 1924 and 1931 at the site of a smaller 18th-century custom house, at a critical location that used to function as the central business district of San Juan during the late 18th and early 19th centuries, and the site of the main port of Puerto Rico (today the main cruise ship port section of Old San Juan) before the construction of the new port ( Puerto Nuevo ) located along the southern edge of the Bay of San Juan . The Colonial Revival design was chosen to preserve the Spanish Colonial character of the area, as it incorporates architectural elements of the former Spanish custom house but also many of the Renaissance and Neo-Gothic elements popular in Spanish architecture of the time. The former Spanish custom house, which also housed a smaller warehouse and post office, was demolished at an unknown date during the first decade of the 20th century. This was done as a territory-wide project to enlarge and upgrade the governmental properties in Puerto Rico during the early 20th century. Construction was made by the Philadelphia -based Richmond and Kemp Ornamental Iron and Bronze and by the North American Wood Products Company of New York City . It was primarily used as a custom and additionally as a warehouse by the American Customs Service in Puerto Rico until the end of World War I . Additional modifications were made in 1957 and 1959 by the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers while air conditioning was installed by 1960. The building is still owned and managed by the U.S. Customs Service.",

La Placita today is a popular dining and nightlife destination in San Juan , while still functioning as a produce and food market during the day.  The market square was established in 1910 when the area was selected by Puerto Rico's government to build a marketplace. The marketplace building had two levels, the first one for kiosks, food and produce stalls and other service businesses, while the second level had the butcher and the meat market. The building originally also had business spaces, including medical offices. The market square building has been renovated and modified on numerous occasions throughout the 20th century, and at some point the second level was demolished to increase the area of the main marketplace. The marketplace lost its importance in the later second half of the 20th century which left the area in various stages of disrepair. The building and the neighborhood were revitalized in the 1990s and 2000s when numerous restaurant and entertainment businesses opened. The area is now one of the liveliest social districts in San Juan and it is famous for its nightlife and gastronomy with its numerous restaurants, cafes, bars and dance clubs.",

He selected the prominent architectural firm of Warren and Wetmore , which had designed New York City's Grand Central Terminal , as well as the Biltmore, Commodore, and Ambassador Hotels. On 16 October 1919, the hotel, having cost a million dollars to construct, was inaugurated. It was suggested that the early Spanish Revival style architecture be used by Fredrick Vanderbilt. Capitalizing on the property's setting adjacent to the Atlantic Ocean, the designers created a Beaux Arts-style structure with white walls, red tiles, French windows, lofty ceilings and other design details typical of the style at the time. The original roofing featured antique Spanish tiles sourced from Puerto Rico's older Spanish buildings. The floors and the public areas including the main staircase were decorated with marble and mosaics and the area between the ocean and the hotel building was developed to help the building withstand damage from the Atlantic coast. The hotel also featured a flagstone paved terrace. Giant pandanus , several kinds of bougainvillea , fruit trees and coconut palms could also be found in the hotel's gardens.",

Engineer Fossas was hired by Manuel, Jose and Amalia Vias Torrijos, owners of the lot, sons of the Puerto Rican lawyer and politician Juan Vias Ochoteco who, in 1908, had bought the building that previously occupied that lot. This emptied lot was formerly the site of a meeting house for a group called Sociedad La Filarmonica ('Society of the Philharmonic'), a scholarly club that was founded by Manuel de Elzaburu and Alejandro Tapia y Rivera with the intention of promoting cultural activities in the city of San Juan.

In 1901, then- Education Commissioner , Martin Grove Brumbaugh , initiated talks with Andrew Carnegie with the purpose of building a public library in San Juan, as part of the United States' Puerto Rican education program . For this, the San Juan municipal legislature had agreed to give $6,000 for maintenance expenses. Carnegie's private secretary, James Bertram , indicated that the amount usually donated was 10 times the promised maintenance expenses. Nevertheless, Brumbaugh obtained the $100,000 amount. This was in part due to then- Governor Arthur Yager's friendship with Carnegie himself. Its origins stem from the Insular Library created in 1903, created by the then-new civil government , which itself came from the military-rule era San Juan Free Library, which was a merger of five pre-existing libraries under Spanish-rule: the library of the Dominican and Franciscan monasteries, the Real Sociedad Economica de Amigos del Pais , the library of the Provincial Council and Treasury Department of Puerto Rico , the library of the Royal College of Lawyers-General Secretary and the library of the Institute of Secondary Education and Normal School.",

The tower was hit by U.S. artillery fire in the Puerto Rican Campaign of the Spanish\u2013American War on May 12, 1898. The lighthouse was rebuilt in 1899 but developed structural problems and was demolished in 1906. The lighthouse was rebuilt in 1908. Public admission tours into the tower are held, and the Castillo San Felipe del Morro , along with Castillo San Cristobal and much of the city walls are part of the San Juan National Historic Site also open to the public.",

As of 2009, the monument was etched with the names of more than 2,000 service members.  The monument largely contains the names of soldiers who had a Puerto Rico address at their time of enlistment and/or death. If a soldier had a stateside address their name is most likely not on the monument. Because so many Puerto Ricans in the military list a United States address, their participation is underrepresented in statistics.",

The forest reserve was first proclaimed in 1998 with the intention of preserving one of the last green areas in San Juan as a secondary forest . The city is very densely populated and has lost most of its forests due to urban sprawl . This was done thanks to the effort of local residents, academics and environmentalists. In 2003 the forest was added to the San Juan Ecological Corridor management zone, also managed by the municipality of San Juan which designates the area as ecologically important as it forms part of the hydrological basin of the estuary of San Juan Bay . Between the years 1998 and 2005 the forest was used for research purposes for studying the impact of Hurricane Georges in the destruction and regrowth of the forest.",

The area was originally considered an important transportation and social center in San Juan. The Tapia Theater was built around this time and inaugurated in 1832. The Christopher Columbus statue was first erected in the area in 1893 to celebrate the 400th anniversary of the European \"discovery\" of Puerto Rico. The statue of Juan Ponce de Leon that used to be located in the center of the square was moved to Plaza San Jose (next to San Jose Church ). Before its construction in 1897, the plaza used to be the eastern end of the defensive wall system that surrounded San Juan. It used to be the location of one of the main city gates, Santiago Gate (Spanish: Puerta de Santiago ). This section of the wall was torn down in the May of 1897 as it was deemed unnecessary and it was considered an obstacle to San Juan's economic growth as the walled district was isolated from the rest of the modern city. The statue of Columbus atop its column at the center of the square caused people to start referring to the plaza as Plaza Colon rather than Plaza Santiago. The square today is paved with marble tiles and lightened by adorned lamp posts which were installed during the revitalization of the area in the latter half of the 20th century.",

In the nineteenth century, major health problems affected the Puerto Rican population. Anemia, malnutrition and parasitism were some of the most common conditions in children and adults. With the arrival of U.S. troops in 1898, the need for effective health plans to serve the population became a priority. With the change of sovereignty, anemia commissions were established in Puerto Rico. Thus began the development of what would become the Institute of Tropical Medicine, which was formalized in 1912.",

The market square was established in 1910 when the area was selected by Puerto Rico's government to build a marketplace. The marketplace building had two levels, the first one for kiosks, food and produce stalls and other service businesses, while the second level had the butcher and the meat market. The building originally also had business spaces, including medical offices. The market square building has been renovated and modified on numerous occasions throughout the 20th century, and at some point the second level was demolished to increase the area of the main marketplace. The marketplace lost its importance in the later second half of the 20th century which left the area in various stages of disrepair. The building and the neighborhood were revitalized in the 1990s and 2000s when numerous restaurant and entertainment businesses opened. The area is now one of the liveliest social districts in San Juan and it is famous for its nightlife and gastronomy with its numerous restaurants, cafes, bars and dance clubs.",

Located in San Juan's Parque Central (Central Park) the natatorium is regarded as the most advanced natatorium in the Caribbean and 4th in the entire world as of October 2007. [ citation needed ] The facility is used to host local and international events such as the 2nd A.S.U.A Pan American Masters Swimming Championship, as well as an important United States collegiate winter practice venue for many NCAA-affiliated colleges and universities. San Juan's Mayor Jorge Santini opened the new roofed San Juan Natatorium, developed by San Juan Sports Director Maria Elena Batista on December 15, 2006.  The San Juan Natatorium was built in December 2006. It includes an Olympic-size 50-meter pool convertible to two, 25-meter pools, 10 lanes each 5 meterwide with permanent starting blocks. It has an adjustable depth from 9\u2019 to 0\u2019 and is completely indoors with open walls. A second adjacent diving pool is used for additional warm-up during events. The Natatorium has conference rooms for technical meetings, medical facilities, a commercial gym and is the venue for Batista's departmental offices. The facility is equipped with Daktronics timing equipment and a control room. It has a capacity for 2000 spectators and 1800 additional removable chairs. The design was based on the Atlanta Olympic Center where the 1996 Olympics were held.",

The word \" stud \" comes from the Old English stod meaning \"herd of horses, place where horses are kept for breeding\". Historically, documentation of the breedings that occur on a stud farm leads to the development of a stud book . Male animals made available for breeding to outside female animals are said to be \"standing at stud\", or at \"stud service\".  The word stud is often restricted to larger domesticated (especially farm) animals, such as cattle and horses . A specialized vocabulary exists for the studs of other animals, such as kennel (dog), cattery (cat) and aviary (birds).",

On 18 January 1862, the local Bishop of Tarbes Bertrand-Sev\u00e8re Laurence endorsed the veneration of the Blessed Virgin Mary in Lourdes.

Silt has also made some portions of the land inaccessible by boat.

It was designated a National Natural Landmark in 1980 and constitutes an area of 3,590 acres. It consists mostly of subtropical wet and moist karst forest . Mogotes and sinkholes fill the landscape. The forest preserve is located in the municipalities of Arecibo and Utuado . In addition to its ecological value the forest also contains a number of archaeological sites.  Much of the development within the forest area was made by the Civilian Conservation Corps (CCC) during the 20th century. The forest preserve was one of the five designated forests designated in 1943 by the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (Spanish: Administracion de Reconstruccion de Puerto Rico ) to preserve the remaining forested areas in the island. This forest also protects a large portion of the Arecibo River hydrological basin. The remains of the lumber roads cut by the loggers and CCC workers have now become trails. Due to its value as an ideal representation of the karstic ecosystems in Puerto Rico and the Caribbean, the state forest was designated a National Natural Landmark by the United States Department of Interior in 1980.",

The beach is surrounded by natural limestone seawalls that protect it from the often violent swells of the Atlantic Ocean . These rocks form a natural shallow pool with calm waters that is perfect for families and children. Larger waves do occasionally reach this shallow pool during stormy weather leaving tide pools behind. The western side of the beach is located away from the limestone rocks and while considered more dangerous it can be ideal for surfing .",

The light was established to guide through the dangerous passage formed by a chain of reefs. It was of key importance for navigation in the San Juan Passage.  In 1992, the lighthouse was restored in celebration of the 500th anniversary of Christopher Columbus 's first voyage to America.

It is also Puerto Rico's highest cloud forest . It is in the Cordillera Central region of the island and covers 8,204 cuerdas (7,968 acres; 3,224 ha; 32.24 km 2 ), of mountains. Toro Negro's mountains have heights reaching up to 4,400 feet (1,300 m) and include Cerro de Punta , Cerro Jayuya and Cerro Rosa , the three highest peaks in the island. Nested among these mountains is Lake Guineo, the island's highest lake. The forest has 18 kilometers (11 mi) of trails, an observation tower, two natural swimming pools ( Spanish :\" charcos \"), camping and picnic areas, nine rivers, and numerous creeks and waterfalls. The forest spans areas within the municipalities of Ponce , Jayuya , Orocovis , Ciales , and Juana Diaz , and consists of seven non-contiguous tracts of land. The largest contiguous segment of the forest is located in the municipalities of Ponce and Jayuya. Some 40% of the area of Toro Negro State Forest is located in Ponce's Barrio Anon .  When created in 1935 as part of the Caribbean National Forest , the Toro Negro Forest Reserve was managed by the United States government , first via the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration of the Department of the Interior (1935\u20131942) and later through the Forest Service of the Department of Agriculture (1942\u20131970). Then, in 1970, the Federal Government exchanged with the Government of the Commonwealth of Puerto Rico the Toro Negro section of the Caribbean National Forest for some forested lands belonging to the Commonwealth and located adjacent to the much larger federal lands at Luquillo National Forest resulting in the creation at Luquillo of the current El Yunque National Forest . In 1970, the Government of Puerto Rico's Departmento de Recursos Naturales y Ambientales (DRNA) opened the Toro Negro Forest Reserve as a Commonwealth state forest and renamed it Bosque Estatal de Toro Negro (Toro Negro State Forest).",

The house was designed by architect Antonio Mattei Lluberas and built in 1893 by Angelo Cesari Poggi ( Angel Cesari Poggi in its localized Spanish spelling) of the Cesari Antongiorgi family, a Corsican-Puerto Rican family who was important in the development of the sugarcane industry of Yauco and southwestern Puerto Rico.  The two storey manor house has a distinctive L-shape that borders the corner of the Matienzo Cintron and 25 de Julio streets. The main structure is made of thick concrete masonry walls with wooden beams that support a flat brick roof. The wooden window designs became a typeface and inspiration for other private residences that were built afterwards in Yauco and beyond. The house is notable for the integration of various types of traditional construction techniques of time while also importing new techniques foreign in Puerto Rico at the time such as the use of forged cast iron in both the structural and ornamentation systems of the building. The cast iron was built and imported from the Saint-Louis Foundry in Paris . The architectural style of the building is eclectic and foreign in the island at the time of its construction, bringing inspiration from the French Creole designs which were famous in New Orleans at the time.",

While Monte Guilarte is located in the municipality of Adjuntas , the forest's borders also include parts of Guayanilla , Penuelas and Yauco .  In 1935, the Puerto Rico Reconstruction Administration (Spanish: Administracion de Reconstruccion de Puerto Rico ) acquired 3,500 acres in and around Monte Guilarte in the municipality of Adjuntas with the goal of preserving the area as a forest reserve. The reserve was intended to be a wildlife preserve for the conservation of numerous plant and animal species found in the area but also for recreational purposes. Today the forest is managed by the Puerto Rico Department of Natural and Environmental Resources (DRNA), which has enlarged the protected area of the forest which now extends 4,822 acres.",

Located about 1,000 miles (1,600 km) southeast of Miami , Florida , between the Dominican Republic in the Greater Antilles and the U.S. Virgin Islands in the Lesser Antilles , it consists of the eponymous main island and numerous smaller islands, including Vieques , Culebra , and Mona . With approximately 3.2 million residents , it is divided into 78 municipalities , of which the most populous is the capital municipality of San Juan , followed by those within the San Juan metropolitan area . Spanish and English are the official languages of the government , though Spanish predominates.  Puerto Rico was settled by a succession of Amerindian peoples beginning 2,000 to 4,000 years ago; these included the Ortoiroid , Saladoid , and Taino . It was claimed by Spain following the arrival of Christopher Columbus in 1493 and subsequently colonized by Juan Ponce de Leon in 1508. Puerto Rico was contested by other European powers into the 18th century but remained a Spanish possession for the next 400 years. The decline of the indigenous population , followed by an influx of Spanish settlers, primarily from the Canary Islands and Andalusia , and African slaves vastly changed the cultural and demographic landscape of the archipelago. Within the Spanish Empire , Puerto Rico played a secondary but strategically significant role compared to larger and wealthier colonies like Peru and New Spain . By the late 19th century, a distinct Puerto Rican identity began to emerge, centered around a fusion of European , African , and indigenous elements. In 1898, following the Spanish\u2013American War , Puerto Rico was acquired by the United States .",

Geography is an all-encompassing discipline that seeks an understanding of Earth and its human and natural complexities \u2014not merely where objects are, but also how they have changed and come to be. While geography is specific to Earth, many concepts can be applied more broadly to other celestial bodies in the field of planetary science . Geography has been called \"a bridge between natural science and social science disciplines.\"  Origins of many of the concepts in geography can be traced to Greek Eratosthenes of Cyrene, who may have coined the term \"geographia\" ( c. 276 BC \u2013 c. 195/194 BC ). The first recorded use of the word \u03b3\u03b5\u03c9\u03b3\u03c1\u03b1\u03c6\u03af\u03b1 was as the title of a book by Greek scholar Claudius Ptolemy (100 \u2013 170 AD). This work created the so-called \"Ptolemaic tradition\" of geography, which included \"Ptolemaic cartographic theory.\" However, the concepts of geography (such as cartography ) date back to the earliest attempts to understand the world spatially, with the earliest example of an attempted world map dating to the 9th century BCE in ancient Babylon . The history of geography as a discipline spans cultures and millennia, being independently developed by multiple groups, and cross-pollinated by trade between these groups. The core concepts of geography consistent between all approaches are a focus on space, place, time, and scale.",

With a $8.9 billion revenue in 2022 (a 39% increase over the previous high in 2019), tourism has been a very important source of revenue for Puerto Rico for a number of decades given its favorable warm climate, beach destinations and its diversity of natural wonders, cultural and historical sites, festivals, concerts and sporting events. As Puerto Rico is an unincorporated territory of the United States , U.S. citizens do not need a passport to enter Puerto Rico, and the ease of travel attracts many tourists from the mainland U.S. each year.  In 2017, Hurricane Maria caused severe damage to the island and its infrastructure. The damage was estimated at $100 billion. An April 2019 report indicated that by that time, only a few hotels were still closed, that life for tourists in and around the capital had, for the most part, returned to normal. By October 2019, nearly all of the popular amenities for tourists, in the major destinations such as San Juan , Ponce and Arecibo , were in operation on the island and tourism was rebounding. This was important for the economy, since tourism provides up 10% of Puerto Rico's GDP, according to Discover Puerto Rico. The COVID-19 pandemic in 2020, however, greatly affected this gradual recovery, and it was not until 2022 that tourism numbers would demonstrate a concrete recovery of the tourism industry in the island.",
