Dorado is subdivided into five barrios and Dorado Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area . During the early 18th century, there were already mentions of a \"Sitio de Dorado\" (meaning a golden place) in some San Juan registers. Since the beginning of the Spanish colonial period and until 1831, Dorado existed as a barrio (or ward ) of the town of Toa Baja . Over several years, the ward grew and established its own town center called the \"new pueblo\" to differentiate itself from Toa Baja, which became known as the \"old pueblo.\" Over several years, the barrios that currently make up Dorado grew and the people of the \"new pueblo\" wanted to separate themselves from Toa Baja. On November 22, 1842, Jacinto L\u00f3pez Mart\u00ednez, the Sergeant at Arms for the ward of Dorado, petitioned the Spanish Governor of Puerto Rico , Santiago M\u00e9ndez Vigo , to establish the municipality of Dorado. The governor authorized the founding of the town pending the construction of public works, including an administrative building and a church near the town square. In 1848, the construction of the public works were completed and L\u00f3pez Mart\u00ednez became the first mayor of Dorado. Puerto Rico was ceded by Spain in the aftermath of the Spanish\u2013American War under the terms of the Treaty of Paris of 1898 and became a territory of the United States. In 1902, four years after the Spanish\u2013American War , Dorado was again appended to Toa Baja. But in 1905 it regained its status as a separate town. Nowadays, Dorado has upscale neighborhoods and a small downtown area with a plaza (main town square ), as other Puerto Rican municipalities. The town's patron saint is Anthony of Padua , and patron saint celebrations are held at the plaza every year on June 13. Tourism in Dorado: Dorado's cultural activities feature all of the traditional Puerto Rican elements, but focus on African and Spanish elements. Ta\u00edno elements are more conspicuous and mostly influence the food. Popular culture is promoted, which is represented by a number of interpreters such as Juan Boria, Joe Valle and Horacio Olivo. Local painters include Jos\u00e9 Bernandino and Marcos J. Alegr\u00eda. In the early 20th century the Rockefeller family purchased plots of land in the northwest region of the municipality of Dorado where they built a huge private vacation compound. Laurance Rockefeller would later use this land to create Dorado Beach Hotel and Golf Club, which later became the Dorado Beach Hyatt Hotel which closed in 2007. Dorado Beach Hotel became a Ritz Carlton hotel in 2012, which got the top spot in the 2019 Conde Naste Readers' Choice. Dorado has long been known as a golf haven. Its tourist industry includes the Dorado Beach Resort (Ritz-Carlton Reserve & Plantation), the Hyatt Hacienda del Mar, and Embassy Suites in the Dorado Del Mar neighborhood. As of 2014 there are three operating golf courses in the municipality, the Dorado Beach East Course, the Plantation Sugarcane Course and the Plantation Pineapple Course. The Dorado del Mar course closed in 2014. Culture in Dorado: To stimulate local tourism, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company launched the Voy Turistiendo (\"I'm Touring\") campaign, with a passport book and website.

It was founded as Pueblo de Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de la Candelaria de Mayag\u00fcez (Township of Our Lady of Candelaria ), and is also known as La Sultana del Oeste (The Sultaness of the West), Ciudad de las Aguas Puras (City of Pure Waters), or Ciudad del Mang\u00f3 (Mango City). On April 6, 1894, the Spanish Crown granted it the formal title of Excelente Ciudad de Mayag\u00fcez (Excellent City of Mayag\u00fcez). Mayag\u00fcez is located in the center of the western coast on the island of Puerto Rico. It has a population of 73,077, and it is the principal city of the Mayag\u00fcez Metropolitan Statistical Area (pop. 213,831) and the Mayag\u00fcez\u2013Aguadilla, PR Combined Statistical Area (pop. 467,599). The Mayag\u00fcez Metro Area (and part of A\u00f1asco ) lies today on two former Ta\u00edno Cacicazgos (chiefdoms) : Yaguex and Yag\u00fceca, a region noted for its record of colonial resistance (i.e., Urayo\u00e1n and Legend of Diego Salcedo ). The Tainos constituted the majority of the island's inhabitants at the time of contact with Europeans in 1493 and called it Borik\u00e9n or Borinquen . Today, this appellation and its variations continue to designate the Island of Puerto Rico and its people. The Ta\u00ednos came from South American branches of Arawakan speakers , more specifically from modern-day Venezuela , and lived in small villages, organized their society in clans and named their chiefs Cacique . They were farmers who domesticated crops as pineapples , cassava , and sweet potatoes supplemented by fish and seafood.

E. Franco & Co., a bakery, food importer, and restaurant established in the late 1850s, is the best-known provider of brazos gitanos in town. Another (more recent) provider is Ricomini Bakery, whose central store in downtown Mayag\u00fcez has been open for over 100 years.\n  - Papalaya \u2013 a Latin-American cuisine food truck chain known for its \"nachos with grated cheese , pico de gallo and in-house sauce\".\n  - Sangr\u00eda de Fido \u2013 the heirs of Wilfrido Aponte still bottle \"Sangr\u00eda de Fido\", a powerful concoction inspired by sangria , but made with fruit juices, Bacardi 151 rum and burgundy wine (technically not from Bourgogne , but produced by E & J Gallo Winery in Modesto, California ). It had been bottled by hand by the bartender since the mid-1970s. \"Sangr\u00eda de Fido\" has a sizeable reputation outside Puerto Rico, and can claim tasters from as far away as California and Spain. E & J Gallo once awarded Aponte with a \"Customer of the Year\" award and flew him to their headquarters. Aponte was reportedly offered $250,000 by Bacardi to sell his original recipe once, to which he refused.\n  - Bolo's Sorullitos \u2013 a now-defunct operation that originated at Bolo's Restaurant, a seaside eatery next to Mayag\u00fcez Bay , which produced sorullitos, or fried cornsticks, along with mayo-ketchup , a dip made of mayonnaise , ketchup , and garlic extract. The restaurant was popular in Puerto Rico between the late 1970s and mid-1980s (its custom-made building now houses WORA-TV , one of the local television stations). For a while the frozen cornsticks were sold commercially in stores.\n  - Flan-Es-Ced\u00f3' \u2013 Elmec Industries, Inc. has been the local flan producer for over thirty years\n  - India / Medalla beer \u2013 the only remaining mass-produced Puerto Rican beer is brewed by \" Cervecer\u00eda India \", one of the largest employers in town.

The two flagship stores in Mayag\u00fcez, however, are still popular (particularly on Good Friday , since one of the stores is the endpoint for a Good Friday religious procession) for producing alternative ice cream flavors, particularly a corn sherbet .\n  - Tuna fish \u2013 At one time, StarKist , Chicken of the Sea , and Bumble Bee produced 80% of their collective production for consumption in the United States in Mayag\u00fcez. The last remaining tuna fish cannery closed in 2012 when Bumble Bee shuttered their operation.\n  - A new distillery was founded in Mayag\u00fcez in 2009, Destiler\u00eda Coqu\u00ed. Its production is limited to 100 bottles a day, their main product is artisan rum called pitorro .",

Morovis is spread over 13 barrios and Morovis Pueblo (the downtown area and the administrative center of the city). It is part of the San Juan-Caguas-Guaynabo Metropolitan Statistical Area . In 1815, a group of residents, under the leadership of Don Juan Jos\u00e9 de la Torre, began the process to separate Morovis from Manat\u00ed . In 1817, the government of Puerto Rico approved the separation, but it was not until 1818 that the requirements of a population of one thousand residents and the construction of a church and several other public buildings was fulfilled, that the municipality of Morovis was officially founded. In 1822, the mayorship was constructed and in 1823, the new church was built, dedicated to Nuestra Se\u00f1ora del Carmen on lands donated by Don Juan Evangelista Rivera. Its first mayor was Don Juan Jos\u00e9 de la Torre, with its second mayor being Don Juan Evangelista Rivera. Morovis has a particular nickname. It was the only municipality in Puerto Rico that did not suffer from a cholera epidemic in 1853; as a result, a common phrase, \"la isla menos Morovis\" (\" (all of) the island but Morovis \") was coined. The phrase is believed by Puerto Ricans from outside of the town to have a negative connotation against morove\u00f1os , while, in reality, it is considered a positive motto.

According to historian Mario Villar Roces, before 1808 there was a community with its own church on the land today known as Sabana Grande Arriba (literally upper great savanna ). Evidence of this is the oldest baptismal registry preserved from the area, as Sabana Grande was originally a sector of the municipality of San Germ\u00e1n.

As of the 2020 census , it is the 57th-most populous city under the jurisdiction of the United States, with a population of 342,259. San Juan was founded by Spanish colonists in 1521, who called it Ciudad de Puerto Rico (Spanish for \"Rich Port City\"). Puerto Rico's capital is the second oldest European-established capital city in the Americas, after Santo Domingo , in the Dominican Republic , founded in 1496, and is the oldest European-established city under United States sovereignty . Several historical buildings are located in the historic district of Old San Juan ; among the most notable are the city's former defensive walls , Fort San Felipe del Morro and Fort San Crist\u00f3bal , and La Fortaleza , the oldest executive mansion in continuous use in the Americas. These historic sites were declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1983. Tourism in San Juan: Santurce is the largest and most populated barrio in the municipality of San Juan, and one of the most densely populated areas of the island (13,257.4 persons per square mile). Santurce, originally named San Mateo de Cangrejos (Saint Matthew of the Crabs), was a settlement for freed African slaves during the early days of the city. After Pablo Ubarri Capetillo, a Spanish railroad developer and Count of San Jos\u00e9 de Santurce under the Spanish colonial period, sought permission to link San Juan with R\u00edo Piedras proper via steam tramway in 1878, the time it took to travel between both points were shortened and thereby stimulated the colonization and growth of the district. At the beginning of the twentieth century an electric trolley was installed, the township was split into three parts, and its main settlement, merged with the city, was renamed using the Spanish spelling of Santurtzi ( Saint George in Basque), Ubarri's birthplace in Vizcaya , Spain. The \"Museo de Arte de Puerto Rico\" ( Puerto Rico Museum of Art ) and other important cultural venues are located in Santurce. This barrio is further divided into subbarrios such as the tourist-oriented neighborhood of Condado , which occupies land that used to be owned by Ubarri Capetillo. Beaches such as nearby Ocean Park , popular with swimmers, surfers and kitesurfers , are found all along the district's Atlantic coastline which is also the locus of numerous hotels. Miramar is mainly a residential area rising south of the Condado Lagoon. It comprises the former barrio of Miraflores, as well as drained marshland and landfill over which was built San Juan's first airport, the Isla Grande airport, which was renamed Fernando Luis Ribas Dominicci Airport in honor of Major Fernando Luis Ribas-Dominicci (USAF). Miramar now hosts the Puerto Rico Convention Center as well as some of San Juan Harbor's cruise ship piers. In 2005 Miramar was designated an historical district of Puerto Rico. Culture in San Juan: The architecture is more varied in other districts of the city, and the different Spanish , American and Puerto Rican construction styles that reflect the historic architecture trends are most evident in the districts of Puerta de Tierra , Santurce , Hato Rey and downtown R\u00edo Piedras , with Gothic , Baroque , Art Deco , and Mid-Century Modern being the most popular styles. Many of the buildings that best exemplify these architectural trends in San Juan are also inscribed in the United States National Register of Historic Places (NRHP), such as the Nuestra Se\u00f1ora de Lourdes Chapel ( Gothic Revival , 1907), the Antiguo Casino de Puerto Rico ( Beaux-Arts , 1917), the Normandie Hotel ( Art Deco , 1942), and the Puerto Rico Supreme Court Building ( Modern , 1955). The University of Puerto Rico, R\u00edo Piedras Campus is also home to a rich variety of buildings that showcase the history of Puerto Rican architecture throughout the past 120 years, with buildings designed by notable architects such as Frank Lloyd Wright 's student Henry Klumb , Edward H. Bennett , William E. Parsons , and Rafael Carmoega who designed the distinctive clock tower and the university quadrangle , both of which were inscribed in the NRHP in 1984. As with the other Puerto Rican municipalities, San Juan is administratively divided into barrios . What is now known as Old San Juan occupied the western end of a rocky islet, the Isleta de San Juan , at the mouth of San Juan Bay. During the 20th century, the main population centers surged well beyond the walls of the old city and onto Puerto Rico's main island and merged with the existing settlements east and south of Old San Juan. Together with Puerta de Tierra , Old San Juan comprises the barrio of San Juan Antiguo .",

Vieques lies about 8 miles (13 km) east of the mainland of Puerto Rico , measuring about 20 miles (32 km) long and 4.5 miles (7 km) wide. Its most populated barrio is the town of Isabel Segunda (or \"Isabel the Second\", sometimes written \"Isabel II\"), the administrative center located on the northern side of the island. The population of Vieques was 8,249 at the 2020 Census. The island's name is a Spanish spelling of a Ta\u00edno word said to mean \"small island\" or \"small land\". It also has the nickname Isla Nena , usually translated as \"girl island\" or \"little girl island\", alluding to its perception as Puerto Rico's little sister. The island was given this name by the Puerto Rican poet Lu\u00eds Llor\u00e9ns Torres . During the British colonial period, its name was Crab Island . Tourism in Vieques: For sixty years the majority of Vieques was closed off by the US Navy, and the island remained almost entirely undeveloped for tourism. This lack of development is now marketed as a key attraction. Vieques is promoted under an ecotourism banner as a sleepy, unspoiled island of rural bucolic charm and pristine deserted beaches, and is rapidly becoming a popular destination. Since the Navy's departure, tensions on the island have been low, although land speculation by foreign developers and fears of overdevelopment have caused some resentment among local residents, and there are occasional reports of lingering anti-American sentiment . Culture in Vieques: Vieques celebrates its patron saint festival in July.
