The bridge is the only reinforced concrete bridge in the area and the highest of its kind in Puerto Rico.[2]It was built in 1922 by the American Railroad Company to replace a 1907 steel bridge  as part of the construction of thenational railway systemthat connected the island during the first half of the twentieth century. It was built on a concrete platform that held the existing steel bridge without interrupting the passage of the railway.[3]The new bridge could hold two locomotives of 84 tons each. It was designed by Etienne Totti fromYaucowho was the head engineer for the company.    The bridge was  restored by the municipality of Quebradillas, unfortunately as part of the repair the base was widened altering the character of the structure and hindering the view of the bridge.[4]It was listed on theNational Register of Historic Placesin 1984 and on thePuerto Rico Register of Historic Sites and Zonesin 2000.[1][5]",
